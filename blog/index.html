				2020 Resolutions</a>
		</h2>
		<div class="meta date">

		<p>The last 10 years was quite a ride. Turning from a kid to a man, I have grown more than my expected thanks to a long list of mentors, brothers, and sisters. It is 2020, and I&rsquo;d like to make it special to kick start the next 10 years. Here come the resolutions for this year.</p>

<h4>Dwarves Foundation</h4>

<p>The company we founded in 2015 has turned 5 and reached its first milestone. It&rsquo;s about time to step down and let others take the throne.</p>

<ul>
<li>Transition: Some transitions are needed for the next generation to take over the company. Everything is quite in shape. The business model is firm. We have a great team of 50-ish, a growth rate of 60% since Day 1, a worth-to-pursue vision, a few missions ahead to accomplish, a playbook with all of our best practices, and a few good hires last year. I&rsquo;m looking for a new CEO for Dwarves Foundation.</li>
<li>Territory: With a good record serving customers in the last 5 years and everything are in place; the business expansion expects to happen both online and offline. Most of the time, we meet and work with our clients via the internet. The pattern works so far, but I believe there&rsquo;s still room for improvement. Why not try to take another business approach? I&rsquo;m looking for business partners to explore the market that we haven&rsquo;t touched.</li>
<li>Employee-owned company: Last year, we distributed company shares to the early employees and had the first batch of dividend pulled off. This year, we will continue to issue the ESOP to the rest privately. Every member who stays with the company for more than 2 years will have chances to earn company stakes.</li>
<li>Fully automation &amp; Data-driven operations: The best part of running your tech company? You have a vast workforce to try all the cool kinds of stuff. We have the data of every part of daily operations, from project development to personal development. All the hiring, branding campaigns, or even accounting &amp; payroll adjustments should base on data. It will help reveal the hidden aspect that you&rsquo;ve ever notice.</li>
<li>A getaway office: It&rsquo;s my dream to have an unconventional office space where the dwarves can escape the city and hang around. One in the mountain and one near the beach. Still, a long way to go.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Dwarves Ventures</h4>

<p>Taking the build capability to the step further, Dwarves Ventures is a micro VC that makes use of our knowledge, experience for years to help tech startups with business &amp; financial models, pitch assist, product design, market testing, MVP &amp; platform development. All the materials, metrics, and tractions to achieve before getting to series A funding round.</p>

<p>Last year, we made an investment into 2 local tech startups in Vietnam in exchange for 5 to 20 percent in equity. One major in Hospitality and one in Wholesale Marketplace. This year, among with the expansion of our core business and Craftsmanship Study Program, we hope to meet more exceptional founders.</p>

<h4>Superbits</h4>

<p>The internet used to be a fun place. Growing up, I couldn&rsquo;t find the same excitement. As per the prediction for the next decade, people tend to lean over the different &amp; personalized, I decided to found the Superbits to help bring those excitement bits back. And we are not the only team want to do that, there&rsquo;s another that bring cool bits back to the internet for years. One of them: <a href="https://100r.co">100r.co</a></p>

<p>We started last year with a few macOS apps to help with the productivity boost. This year we will continue to look at this same topic.</p>

<h4>A hedge fund for indie &amp; retail investors</h4>

<p>We build an autobot &amp; apply quantitative methods into the global financial trading market, dedicated to producing exceptional returns. For the exceptional returns, I mean a few bucks for hundreds USD saving, LOL. It can&rsquo;t make us rich but can help make life easier, financially. It is still in beta testing, and I&rsquo;m looking for friends who are interested in &amp; also want to get the first taste. Please drop me a message at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#x68;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x63;&#x61;&#x73;&#x68;&#x62;&#97;&#x67;&#x2e;&#120;&#121;&#122;">&#x68;&#97;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x63;&#x61;&#115;&#x68;&#x62;&#x61;&#103;&#46;&#x78;&#x79;&#x7a;</a></p>

<h4>Learn another language</h4>

<p>I barely speak English. It&rsquo;s not so proficient, and I&rsquo;m not a type to learn anything to excellence. So instead of getting a higher degree in English, I&rsquo;d love to learn another language. Chinese &amp; Japanese are on my list for now.</p>

<h4>Be a dad</h4>

<p>And finally, be a good dad. Learn to parent. I&rsquo;m going to be a dad in about a month or two. I gave him a cool name, bought him a domain, hodl a few tokens in case they will go skyrocket. I&rsquo;m still not ready for this, but let see what may come in the future.</p>

				Spring Internship 2019</a>

		<h3>The program</h3>

<p>This is a second Internship Program at Dwarves Foundation. Held in Spring of 2019, we handpicked every single candidate that passed our CCAT test. Changing our measurement metrics from the last program, we aim to select the candidates not just with strong background, bilingual, and also we feel that they are unconventional.</p>

<p>Over 160 candidates, we only selected 12. They are divided into three groups, each group with people from backend, mobile, and web.
Golang is still the primary language that they have to learn and practice in the first month. Golang is a handy but straightforward language to get people on the same coding page. With Golang they can quickly pick up the language and then focus on the problem set they need to solve.</p>

<p>After the first month, they went back to their career choice. If they want to do web, at this point in time, they will know a whole web front and the backend. If they want to do mobile development, they will know how the backend works, not just their view components. For the backend guy, we will continue to teach them a bit of how the deployment works. The main point is still to get them the whole picture of the system they gonna build.</p>

<p>Learning from the last program, this year, we tried to add in the missing pieces of software development knowledge that they haven&rsquo;t been taught in school or in open source projects. To distinguish Coder, Programmer, and Software Engineer, they need to learn the difference. The training program includes a quick glance over</p>

<ul>
<li>Software Engineering Introduction</li>
<li>Software Modelling</li>
<li>Software Architecture</li>
<li>Software Construction</li>
<li>Software Process</li>
<li>Software Quality</li>
</ul>


<script async="true" class="speakerdeck-embed" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" data-id="82a845337784492580099fc2fe264db5" src="https://speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"> </script>


<h3>Its goal</h3>

<p>The program was designed to bring hands-on experience to the candidates. Applying Pair Programming practice, we assign each group to a specific mentor. They had their time learned from the mentors on the developing products.</p>

<ul>
<li>A DevOps web app wrapping over Google Cloud, Azure, and AWS to provide a single interface, manage an entire lifecycle of an application.</li>
<li>A system that aggregates schedule from all the sports events and deeply integrates to your personal calendar.</li>
</ul>


<p>Experience all the best practices from codebase structure; multiple environments from development, testing, staging, and production; gitflow with pull request and code review, microservices architecture, etc.
All the cutting edge technologies from k8s, AWS deployment, react redux, Netlify, Cloudflare &hellip;</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>

<h4>The metrics</h4>

<ul>
<li>Strong background</li>
<li>Bilingual</li>
<li>Unconventional</li>
<li>Growth potential</li>
</ul>


<p>We say yes to students with a strong foundation, growth potential, and good English. The student with a strong foundation has a step forward compared to other students. They can pick up thing very quick and ready for the real project. The candidates with a right attitude toward professional will win the position.</p>

<h4>Average age</h4>

<p>The best year to apply for an internship at Dwarves Foundation?
We think the senior students are the most suitable for the internship program. We are likely picking 80% of senior students than 3rd year and 2nd year. The senior students will have more chance to focus on fulltime job after their graduation.</p>

<h4>Diversity</h4>

<p>There are more female candidates this year. We love to increase gender diversity in the team to bring perspectives. Despite the fact that female staff still have disadvantages to win the leadership position due to stress and heavy workload.</p>

<h4>Culture</h4>

<p>The interns love our culture. Having a healthy team culture provides a good environment for self-developing. It feels like they are already a part of the team.</p>

<h4>Time</h4>

<p>Three months are still too short for them to absorb the program. The first month is for fundamental catching up. The next two months are for hands-on experience.</p>

<h4>Next program</h4>

<p>Despite the fact that all the metrics are essential, we feel that during the first days of their careers, the attitude is the most important characteristic. The next batch should be more on attitude over skill. 80% of interns with good attitude tend to be hardworking</p>

<h4>University</h4>

<p>Candidates from top universities like the University of Science or the University of Technology have a stronger background than others. But at the same time, they are not bilingual, which affect their confidence in working in multiple culture environment. Top candidates learned English by themselves.</p>

<h4>Technology</h4>

<p>80% of candidates want to learn technologies over foundation knowledge. Most of them can&rsquo;t tell the difference between software service firm and product company. Trendy technologies like blockchain and AI still catch their eyes.</p>

				DFG: Dwarves Foundation Gem</a>

		<h4>Foundation token: DFG</h4>

<p>Following the practice of Securities Token Offering, we are getting our tokens considered as shares with <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-884.md">ERC-884</a>. The tokens &amp; its transactions are recording in Ethereum decentralized computing network, powered by blockchain technology. In other terms, owning one token simply equals owning one share of the company, which entitles the shareholder of all his rights, notably voting and dividend rights.</p>

<p>The token value reflected by the valuation of the company by evaluating</p>

<ul>
<li>Assets (furniture, computers, cash, AR, investments, etc)</li>
<li>Liabilities (debt, AP, current payroll, leases, etc)</li>
<li>Present value of expected future profits (growth rate)</li>
</ul>


<p>The token was naming:  DFG / Dwarves Foundation Gem. The first contract was deployed to Ethereum network last week, and you can track it on <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x36779A12eAb9B054bc991143751Ed5B05568eE8d">Etherscan</a>.</p>

<p>This also marks our first milestone in building our global software firm. We have a plan for all of us to be financially happy in the long-term goal where the dwarves could own parts of the company.</p>

<h4>The first allocation</h4>

<p>The first batch of tokens (RSU) will be issued to those very first members of Dwarves Foundation who has dedicated themselves to the development of the company from Day 1.</p>

<p>Beside the joined date and contribution, the allocation also reflects the risks that you decided to take with the team. High risk high pay.</p>

<ul>
<li>Quang Le: joined on Feb 2015, Quang is the 3rd member. During his soon-to-be five years serving the company vision, he has dedicated himself into everything, from day-to-day activities, project works, and the true craftsmen behind the company infrastructure. Thanks for all the hard works.</li>
<li>Hieu Phan: joined on May 2015, the 5th member. Without his help and dynamics from Day 1, the team couldn&rsquo;t make it till today. Thanks for all the hard works.</li>
<li>Huy Giang: joined on Sep 2016. Taking the position of Frontend Lead, his specialty, work ethic, and contributions help to increase the engineering standard. Thanks for all the hard works.</li>
<li>Minh Tran: joined on April 2017 as Operations, PM and Frontend Dev. Although it was quite a challenge for Minh at the moment, his efforts to get things done was recognized and highly appreciated. Thanks for all the hard works.</li>
</ul>


<h4>What to expect after the first batch?</h4>

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s still a large amount of tokens reserved for people who can bring us to the next level as we are still missing a few important positions: VP of Engineering, VP of Business Development and Technical PM.</li>
<li>On this October, the valuation dashboard will go live at <a href="https://ir.d.foundation">https://ir.d.foundation</a></li>
<li>The Foundation directors who are committing to the company will receive the Options Plan with huge discount. Performance review required.</li>
<li>End of this December, a few more tokens will be reserved for key members which they could buy via ESOP. Also a few rewards for 2019 contributions.</li>
<li>Publish ESOP policy for all members. 20% discount.</li>
<li>And finally, for members from last internship programs, you will be given the challenges when you reach the middle level.</li>
</ul>

		<p>You might have known that I&rsquo;m building the software organization called The Dwarves in the last four years. The team reached the size of 50 several months ago. The average member age is around 26. They are smart and talented. They are young, well-educated, and hard-working toward success.</p>

<p>With a different expectation in engineering standard, we rarely hire people outside of our circle. We handpick and recruit the individual whom we feel they are the one matching with the engineering-driven culture that we are pursuing. We also decided to hire high potential freshers and train them from scratch. It&rsquo;s costly to do such a thing, but we believe good things take time. That&rsquo;s the way we hire for culture (and values).</p>

<p>The culture we are pursuing is the combination between the unconventional spirit and the will to do the right things in every piece of our decision, not just follow the existing of which has been said for years. From the outside perspective, it seems to be ridiculous to develop such an organization:</p>

<ul>
<li>from gather people with like mind and build the organization we&rsquo;d love to work at</li>
<li>where judgments are fair and run by the right ideas</li>
<li>people payout are equal to their contribution so they can make money and be cool at the same time</li>
<li>people should commit to the quality, not the sales quantity</li>
<li>the team members have time to think about the next problem they want to solve or can join the team on self-development progress.</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s like Utopia for software engineers and innovators.</p>

<p>The thought about an unusual business approach, high risk, and considerable chances to fail often appear in my head. But things are getting confident in me over time. There are few companies out there did the same thing, and they stood out.</p>

<p>Remember when Steve Job talked about why he didn&rsquo;t hire the professional managers? In the fast-paced industry like tech, the developer turned manager rule the works. The professional managers can&rsquo;t do crap about that. Managing at Dwarves Foundation is a part-time occupation, next to being involved with doing the work itself.</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rQKis2Cfpeo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<p><strong>And running by ideas is the best way to hire great people.</strong></p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f60dheI4ARg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<p><strong>Some companies care about the work output, not chairs.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://basecamp.com/books/remote"><img src="/notes/images/blog/2019-07-16-guessing.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Or when they accept the truth that planning is guessing.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://basecamp.com/books/rework"><img src="/notes/images/blog/2019-07-16-planning.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I love the unconventional way they see and describe the world, not in the fascinating prism but the true nature.</p>

<p>We seek those kinds of people to join our team. The one which is distinctive, with a different approach and can see things in their bare form, know the truth, and be optimistic about the future are the right people we&rsquo;d love to work.</p>

<p>Recently, an intern shared <a href="https://qz.com/1279371/this-physicists-ideas-of-time-will-blow-your-mind/">this post</a> about quantum physics, time and it blew my mind. It reminds me of how lucky I am to have them in the team.</p>

<p>Tech industry is the destination and interference zone between sectors. It&rsquo;s the most fast-pacing environment and the future where human will put all the effort to push its boundary. The Dwarves are running along with the world, and we are welcome you to join us on this journey. We can&rsquo;t promise you the world, but we can guarantee you it will be a fun ride.</p>

<h1>Software is changing the world</h1>

<p>Software is all around us, yet few people think much about the many ways that software impacts the world every day. The history of computing is often said to start with the tactical problems engineers needed to solve in World War II, but it wasn&rsquo;t until 1941 that engineer Konrad Zuse designed a digital computer capable of using software to solve general problems. During the 1950s, standardized programming languages emerged from the need to reproduce old software on new hardware. By the 1960s, software &ndash; until then given away for free with new computers &ndash; was being produced and sold to end users. By the 1980s, software companies saw the potential in the user-friendly graphical interfaces we are now familiar with. Apple started producing operating systems in the mid-1980s and Microsoft in the early 1990s, leading to the era of convenient and fast software. Internet was invented in 1983 with cloud computing and big data era follow up in the next 20 years. Decentralization with p2p communication, blockchain and bitcoin are booming up in the last 5 years. Today, software is all around us.</p>

<p>Software is used by businesses to communicate worldwide. It is used to operate some of the most complex medical machines. It regulates nuclear plants, electrical grids, and other utilities that provide the basics of life. Of course, it is also behind the safe operation of more than 31 million commercial airline flights in the U.S. each year.</p>

<p>Software also helps make life convenient. For example, computer software has made it easier than ever to connect with friends all over the world using social networks. As software becomes more integrated into electronics and appliances, it will continue to simplify life&rsquo;s challenges. As an example, everyone is familiar with how much easier it is to drive from point A to point B thanks to on-board GPS software. Refrigerators can now notify owners about spoiled food; lights around town and in your home can brighten when they detect you walking in the dark; televisions can make suggestions and record your favorite shows based on your preferences.</p>

<p>Whatever the future holds, it is a good bet that software will remain a very important part of it. As computer software becomes more sophisticated, it will help people with more complex challenges. In the future, software may even help us to regulate and improve our own bodies! Today&rsquo;s wearable technology and implanted medical devices are just the beginning of what the next generation of software can do.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the pass to future. The performance and survival of a large number of organizations now depend on their ability to integrate digital at the heart of their business strategy. The world can&rsquo;t operate without software.</p>

<h1>The Dwarf Principles</h1>

<p>Our definition of Engineering Philosophy, the guiding ideas that help to shape up the way we think and work, to ensure the core values and to deliver quality softwares.</p>

<p>The performance and survival of a large number of organizations now depend on their ability to integrate digital at the heart of their business strategy. This manifesto documents 15 principles that, our team believes, are the cornerstone to creating exceptional digital products that reach their objectives and stand the test of time.</p>

<h2><strong>Engineering Drive</strong></h2>

<p><em>We build a company where software engineering discipline could shine, innovative and quality products are shipped and change the world for the better.</em></p>

<h4>SYSTEMATIC DISCIPLINE</h4>

<p>Software engineering is an engineering discipline that’s applied to the development of software in a systematic approach.</p>

<p>Not applying software engineering methods results in more expensive, less reliable software, and it can be detrimental on the long term, as the changes come in, the costs will dramatically increase.</p>

<h4>ENGINEERS ARE NOT COMMODITIES</h4>

<p>In every software, the engineering team is one of the most imporant factors to make it successful. Software is more of an artisanship, and software engineers aren&rsquo;t a replaceable cog.</p>

<p>People have an assembly line mindset left over from the industrial age. Don’t believe the one-size-fits-all interview process with whiteboarding problems. These serve to grind away the individuality and make us feel like an assembly line worker.</p>

<h4>THE BEST IDEA WINS</h4>

<p>If you have a great idea and the will to see it through, you can effect great change. Nothing is off limits—we’re constantly looking for improvements in our products, our processes, and our people.</p>

<p>All voices are equal here—we hire people to have an opinion and be creative. If your idea makes the most sense, that’s what we’re doing, regardless of your role or seniority.</p>

<p>We learned the practice from an A team, and it is beneficial by helping to strengthen the flat organizational structure.</p>

<p><img class="left half" src="/notes/images/blog/2019-05-23-dwarf.png"></p>

<h2><strong>The Craftsmanship</strong></h2>

<h4>WELL-CRAFTED SOFTWARE</h4>

<p>We humbly demonstrate our expertise by delivering quality software. We work toward perfection in every single piece that we produce. We are proud of the well-crafted software that we develop together. We do not tolerate preventable defects.</p>

<h4>QUALITY PAYS</h4>

<p>Good things take time. Quality must be the top priority. In software work, quality problems overwhelm everything else. When quality isn&rsquo;t managed, entire software projects are unmanageable. Software development is intellectual work. Crafting a high quality software requires not just lots of efforts from a team but also the disciplines and proper methods.</p>

<h4>MIND THE DETAILS</h4>

<p>Details matter. We believe small details equate to big success. As such, creating a product that charms users involves adjusting, refining, and perfecting, over and over again. This attention to detail makes all the difference and creates memorable user experiences.</p>

<h4>CHOOSING THE BORING SOLUTION</h4>

<p>Software development is complex enough by nature. When in doubt, go with the boring solution. Using such a boring solution means that you&rsquo;re using simple vocabulary, which greatly increases the chances of everybody understanding you. This will make it a lot easier for everybody to follow along.</p>

<h4>THINK LONG-TERM</h4>

<p>We do not believe in rushing for project and working overtime. We believe in working sustainably and balanced so that we are a happy bunch of sane workers. Software requires good brains to create good codes and good processes. We do not burn out.</p>

<h4>APPLICATIONS NEED SOLID FOUNDATIONS</h4>

<p>Quality products always rely on a solid foundation. There will be a lot of works running on days, weeks, months, and maybe even years building that application. This constant, never-ending maintenance and extension of an application means that its foundation becomes crucial. Much like with a house, it&rsquo;s not a clever idea to save some money by building just a cheap foundation.</p>

<h4>NOTHING IS PERMANENT</h4>

<p>Software moves fast. New technology has enabled us to create new things. The technology you used yesterday maybe deprecated today. Make sure you understand both the old technology and the new one before buying into the next new thing. New technology needs to provide actual value over existing solutions.</p>

<h2><strong>Minifesto</strong></h2>

<h4>RUNNING LEAN</h4>

<p>Lean philosophy regards everything not adding value to the customer as waste. In order to eliminate waste, one should be able to recognize it. Partially done work, extra processes like paperwork and features not often used by customers are waste. Rework or unnecessarily complex solutions are waste. Waiting for other activities, teams, processes is waste. Managerial overhead not producing real value is waste.</p>

<h4>DELIVER AS FAST AS POSSIBLE</h4>

<p>Make it work. Perfect is an enemy of good. Look for perfection, but not yet. First do it, then do it right, then do it better. Any sufficiently complex system cannot be built out of design, it has to be evolved. The shorter the iterations, the better the learning and communication within the team. The sooner the end product is delivered without major defects, the sooner feedback can be received, and incorporated into the next iteration.</p>

<h4>AIM FOR SIMPLICITY</h4>

<p>Simplicity is complicated. Simple is harder than complex. We have to write code for humans not machines. We want readability. Readable means Reliable. It&rsquo;s easier to understand. It&rsquo;s easier to work on. If it breaks, it&rsquo;s easier to fix.</p>

<h4>EFFECTIVE > PRODUCTIVE</h4>

<p>Being productive is about occupying your time—filling your schedule to the brim and getting as much done as you can. Being effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work. We don’t believe in busyness. We believe in effectiveness. Know your priority and do things that matter.</p>

<h4>FAIL FAST, LEARN OFTEN</h4>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of starting all over again. Evaluate your work constantly. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of throwing to the rubbish a project you&rsquo;ve working on last months. When you start from scratch, innovation comes organically inspired by previous experiences. Evaluate your work constantly.</p>

<p>Dwarves Foundation is a software development firm that based in South East Asia. Starting in 2014, we use cutting-edge technology to help tech startups, entrepreneurs and makers to deliver world-class software products.</p>

<h1>The Dwarves of the Year</h1>

<p>Many endeavors have significantly been made by our Dwarves to keep our boat moving over the past year. We have seen the sweat they drop. We have seen the effort they give. We have seen the time we spent together and we cannot stop ourselves treasuring those moments. It gratifies the team to eventually hold an award for the Dwarves of the year.</p>

<p>We understand that success does not come by accident. Breakthrough arrives after hours of working and trying. It pushes us through many considerations to finally reach to these three top-notch nominees among those remarkable hard works:</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2019-01-26-hall-of-fame.png"></p>

<h3>Huy Nguyen — Outstanding</h3>

<p>Considered for his dynamic contribution, Huy distinguishes himself for being enthusiasm towards the work. His striking performance was shown throughout multiple products. Appears to be the frequent workaholic who dedicates his time more than others, Huy did achieve a remarkable growth.
Beside successfully improving the internal competency, Huy is highly recognized for being a dedicated trainer for interns and co-workers.</p>

<h3>Thanh Pham — Honorable Mention</h3>

<p>Thanh differentiates his work performance during the process of development which assigned him the superior skills on visual and animation. Apart from being a devoted employee, he also plays an integral part of backing up the team and training front-end juniors.
Nevertheless, Thanh finds himself hard to fit in with other Dwarves, which explains the reason his ability in leadership is still in need of improvement.</p>

<h3>Hieu Nguyen — Honorable Mention</h3>

<p>Along with achieving breakthrough change on technical skills and meeting deadline on time with high standard workability, Hieu is well known for being proactive and eager to learn new things. Hieu also proves himself as an adept for new Dwarves to look up and get feedback from.
Though he truly give his best for the work, Hieu’s limited ability of teamwork and leadership still prevents him from being more outstanding.</p>

<p>As there is nothing that can help us measure the contribution you have put, we decided to conduct the award by different means. They are expected to claim the prize based on their titles both in cash and in kind, along with a certificate of recognition as a proof of accomplishment, as well as being honored on our Hall of Fame. Every single piece of trying helps us gradually expand the picture. Live long and prosper has been chosen as one of the mindsets to constitute our woodland from the very first day.</p>

<p>For the sake of that to happen, we understand that their benefit comes parallel to the team. So it will be dead wrong if you think there is a benchmark for the means of award. At Dwarves Foundation, recognition does not work that way. The more they contribute, the more guerdon they receive.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2019-01-26-certificate.jpg"></p>

<h1>2018</h1>

<p>2018 has been a fulfilling year for us with many achievements.</p>

<p>We adapted the new team structure; we redefined things we value.</p>

<p>We doubled the office space. We welcomed new dwarves to join us.</p>

<p>We scaled up from 15 to 40ish with all the smart people gathering around and commit to the dream of building our first global software firm.</p>

<p>We learn new ways to get things done; we live by that for a cutting edge product quality. And we wrap it up with the tedious belief of a better triumph.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2019-01-26-year-end-party.jpeg"></p>

<p>Everything is just the beginning of our first chapters and it couldn’t be that great without you. I’m very thankful for all the contributions that you have made and looking forward to 2019 with all of you.</p>

<p>Go (often referred to as Golang) is a free and open source programming language created at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. The language was announced in November 2009; it is used in some of Google&rsquo;s production systems, as well as by other firms.
Over time, Golang has become the most popular language in large scale IT business where system performance and reliability are the most crucial successful key.</p>

<h1>Golang Vietnam Community</h1>

<p>Back in the day, the Chapter started in the late of 2014 as the playground of Dwarves Foundation, a software development firm based in Saigon. They invested in Go and wanted to help organize the community in Vietnam. In the beginning, there are only a few people in the city that takes Go seriously. They used Go for some of their toy projects. Being one of the first gophers in Vietnam in 2013, Han decided to gather the group of gophers to start the Golang Vietnam Community and put it under the help of Google Developer Group (GDG) Vietnam.</p>

<p>The first meetup was held on 2015 March with more than 50 gophers, and it marked the beginning of the Vietnam chapter. Joining the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUserGroups#asia">Go User Groups</a>, Golang Vietnam helps to improve the tech scene by providing lots of activities to gather the community in Vietnam.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2018-12-08-meetup-01.jpg"></p>

<h1>The GopherCon</h1>

<p>GopherCon is one of the largest Golang events in the world. The first GopherCon was taking place in 2013, held annually in Denver, Colorado by Gopher Academy. Thousand of gophers gather every year to GopherCon to meet and celebrate at the conference together. Followed by the first GopherCon, other communities started their chapter after that.</p>

<p>As a part of the Golang community, we are pleased to be launching the first GopherCon Vietnam, the most significant event in Vietnam dedicated exclusively to Go. A community of a passionate Gophers organizes GopherCon Vietnam on a volunteer basis.</p>

<p>The event was expected to serve 200 &ndash; 250 gophers and last for two days from Dec 08 to Dec 09 with the conference on the first day and the workshop on the second day. The organization rolled out slowly from August with the thought that five months was good enough for us to prepare.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2018-12-08-sponsors.png"></p>

<p>Since 2014, Golang adoption has been increasing from 3 to more than 50 companies using Go as the primary language in their systems. Therefore, we don&rsquo;t have many struggles finding bits of help and sponsorship from those companies.</p>

<h1>The Conference</h1>

<p>The conference is open for talks from the developer community. Discussions will be for beginners, intermediate and advanced levels, as well as for the interest of everyone. Our scope of topics will include a broad area, anything in the realm of Go language development.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2018-12-08-stage.jpg"></p>

<p>Speakers submit their talks through PaperCall: <a href="https://www.papercall.io/events/1359">https://www.papercall.io/events/1359</a> and we will pick the best topics from that. List of talks as follows</p>

				Summer Internship 2018</a>

		<p>Dwarves Foundation is a software development firm that based in South East Asia. We use cutting-edge technology to help tech startups, entrepreneurs and makers to deliver world-class products. We build software and scale cloud platform.</p>

<p>In 2018, we launched the first Summer Internship Program for students with or without Engineering background from top universities in southern Vietnam. The program was designed with the purpose to give an opportunity for candidates to experience the real world projects. No coffee runs here. We love watching talented people learn and explore their skills.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2018-11-08-banner.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you apply for a full-time position, we only want to know if you can bring anything to the table. We get you into the real working environment to see if you can perform well among the team and that’s it. For interns, our approach is different. They are usually quite young and without any experience, so no clues to ask if they can bring in something. The intern candidates will walk through two rounds</p>

<ul>
<li>The first one is the Pre-assessment test in 30 minutes for Computer Software Engineer which is including Criteria Cognitive Aptitude Test (CCAT) and Employee Personality Profile (EPP). CCAT measures your ability to problem solve, use new information, and think critically. It will tell employers how quickly you’ll pick up training for your new role. Research shows that cognitive aptitude is one of the best predictors of your job performance. It’s significantly more predictive than interviews, previous job experience, and your education level. Meanwhile, EPP is a general personality inventory that measures twelve personality traits that provide valuable insights into a person’s work styles and how they are likely to interact with co-workers, management, and customers. It can be used for any position and contains position-specific benchmarks that allow administrators to compare an individual’s scores against composite profiles to determine possible job fit.</li>
<li>The candidates scoring more than 23 points in the first round will go to the second to have an interview with our VP of Engineering. We evaluate the background, the problem-solving mindset and a bit of personality to see if the candidate is the right person.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2018-11-08-evaluation.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The program was prepared in 1 month. We posted about the program at the beginning of June and started it from July to October. In such a coincidence, it was also my very first three months working as an Intern when I was 20.</p>

<p>There were 283 applications in total, 142 applicants passed the pre-assessment test and only 14 offers to the interns. That was over our expectation and was the first success for us.</p>

<p>The interns were divided into three small groups: web, mobile, and devops.</p>

<p>We got them to learn Golang as the primary backend language. Golang is Dwarves language of choice to rewrite the modern world. We think as the team the engineers need to understand the core problem that the business wanted to solve, also what is the value that the firm proposes to the customer. Every team members should know the core backend system by getting involved in before building the frontend or dig into the system.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2018-11-08-golang.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Even though Golang is a quick language to pick up and get things done, the schedule was pretty tight with three weeks learning Go and then one week for a small assignment. All the interns were stretched out to their limit.</p>

<p>After the first month, we arranged them to multiple projects with different challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find Friends is a mobile application with instant location sharing features will allow people to locate friends and family easily.</li>
<li>Smithy is an admin dashboard written in Go and VueJS. It is designed to support multiple existed architectures and databases.</li>
<li>Yggdrasil is a business service mesh written in Go.</li>
</ul>


<p>The internship program was tough but fun. Thank you and congratulation for all the hard work.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2018-11-08-cert.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some other fun facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of the interns come from HCM University of Science (US) and University of Information Technology (UIT). They seemed to be more confident and have better engineering background.</li>
<li>Most of them don’t care too much about the company. They want to learn from the people in the company. The internship allowance is not essential.</li>
<li>The average age is 22. The oldest in the batch is 27.</li>
<li>There are three interns studied in a different major, but they decided to join us as Engineer Interns. Brilliant people.</li>
<li>The university in Vietnam teaches them .NET, Java or C++.</li>
<li>And they all think that Blockchain and AI is the most cooling field to work in.</li>
</ul>

<p>End of the Summer program, we received a few messages from the interns that bring us positive motivation for the next program.</p>

		<p>Innovation happens. There are many startups found and raise fund every day. They focus on making significant positive changes, impact millions of people, lead to breakthroughs and support the foundation of economic growth.</p>

<p>Building an innovation startup requires lots of different things, and it is tough. Most of them have to deal with business development, legal, fundraising, team recruitment, and product development at the same time. Tech startups need to move fast and break things.</p>

<p>At some points, growing a startup needs a strong and experienced team behind. The software team that can help to design the system, design the database, produce the well-crafted software, keep the system stable, avoid the technical debt and deliver values is one of the critical pieces to solve the puzzle.</p>

<p>Another motivations for Dwarves Foundation was the lack of respect that service firms receive. Most software companies out there focus on digital transformation and consultancy. They do tricks. They hit and run. The codebase they produced is full of crap and it damages our pride.</p>

<p>This is where Dwarves Foundation comes in.
Despite the fact that service firms scale linearly, their ultimate size is capped and small, they don’t have life-changing exits for their founders, we start Dwarves Foundation as we want to build things right. I’ve always felt that companies like Dwarves Foundation are more important to the economy than the mildly pejorative phrase used to describe them.</p>

<p>Dwarves Foundation is an innovation service firm. We have been building an organization with high standard software practices and business growth capabilities, helping tech startups, entrepreneurs and makers deliver their innovative software product since 2013.</p>

<p><strong>We stand for the craftsmanship in software development</strong>. More than telling people how to do things, as a firm, we take responsibility for collaboratively creating the product of innovation with the client. We value the long-term partnership, and we brought the economic impact through massive product distribution and brought to the market by the clients.</p>

<p>We empower innovation with software craftsmanship. This is what we do here. It takes many forms, and we’re always working towards it.</p>

<h3>The Dwarves</h3>

<p>The story begins in Norse Mythology. After the executed of Ymir, the very first giant of the universe, by Odin has conceived a whole new universe. In the new world, Yggdrasill is a giant ash tree located at the center cradles the nine realms of the cosmos.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2018-03-19-yggdrasill.png"></p>

<p>Dwarf is the small and misshapen creatures that originated as maggots from Ymir’s corpse. They dwell in the mountains deep down in the dark underground of <strong>Svartalfheim</strong>. Dwarves are wisdom, natural good at smithing, mining, and crafting. They are well known for being the best blacksmiths throughout the nine worlds, not only do they have natural abilities to craft weapons and jewelry. They are also excellent engineers and architects.</p>

<p>Dwarvish magic was fundamentally technological know how. They had an unusually high level of skill. There was no shimmering light around the Dwarves, just first rate workmanship. Dwarves greatly pride themselves in their craftsmanship, be it smithing or anything else.</p>

<p>The dwarf is an example of a creature who has the ability that surpasses the known world, presaging the rise of a universe beyond this physical realm. Whatever their origin, the dwarf’s existence plays a role in expanding the imagination.</p>

<p>Aspiring to create a positive breakthrough that can be able to rewrite the new world, we chose the name Dwarves Foundation as the commitment to the vision that we follow.</p>

<p>At our woodland, the Dwarves are encouraged to thoroughly assess and evaluate the product quality before handing it to the customers. By participate in every detail of the work, we take craftsmanship as one of the most fundamental factors of the career transformation for engineers. World-class products require world-class engineers and craftsmanship is what makes it done. Craftsmanship is what flows among the team spirit, or does not exist at all.</p>

<p>We choose innovation to be one of our core values that form ideas to affect the general society undoubtedly. Innovation is not for geniuses working alone, it is an activity that requires the team effort. Being innovative is a part to approach the new era. What that rewards, what can I say, can genuinely lead to significantly remodel the cosmo.</p>
