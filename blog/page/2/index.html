		<h1>Ensure Alignment of Vision</h1>

<p>As you and your cofounder (or cofounders) embark on your entrepreneurial journey together, it’s imperative that you all share the same vision for the purpose and future of your company. It’s easy to get caught up in the thrill of launching a potentially successful startup together, but you all must take the time to establish the existential foundations of the company, and as early as possible, to help prevent the possibility of a drastic falling out later on.</p>

<h3>What Are Your Goals?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Why are you creating this startup?</li>
<li>What need will it fill?</li>
<li>What will your initial product/service offering be?</li>
<li>And what is your strategy for growing the company?</li>
</ul>


<h3>What Are Your Company Values and Philosophy?</h3>

<p>Your company’s success depends on vision alignment (alignment between you and your investors, your employees, and your customers, etc.). Do you share the same priorities? Do you agree on what’s most important to you both personally and for the future of your company?</p>

<h3>How Do You Measure Success?</h3>

<ul>
<li>What do you and your co-founder(s) hope to get out of this business?</li>
<li>How will you know if you’ve achieved your goals?</li>
<li>If you don’t agree on the same goals, how will you know when you’ve achieved them?</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Discussing these issues with your co-founder could get uncomfortable, create rifts, or even uncover deal-breakers. If you are able to successfully have these difficult conversations, this is a testament to your partnership and to the strength of your relationship &mdash; and will serve as a solid foundation from which to grow your business.&rdquo; &ndash; David Ehrenberg</p></blockquote>

<h3>Working Styles and Culture</h3>

<p>Once you and your cofounder have laid down the aspirational and philosophical groundwork for your startup, this is also the ideal time to determine what kind of working environment best complements the vision of your startup.</p>

<ul>
<li>What 3 words best describe the startup culture you want to create (e.g. open, hard-working, eccentric, etc.)? Pro-tip: If you’re really serious and far along go visit few office spaces together to get a sense of what each of you likes work environments wise and why.</li>
<li>What values do we want to instill in our employees?</li>
<li>If you could pick 2 things to change about our company, and two things to bring with you from your previous experience, what would they be and why?</li>
<li>How much equity are we allocating for future employees?</li>
<li>What should we look for in our first 5 hires?</li>
<li>Describe your ideal working style.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Legal Decisions &amp; Definitions</h1>

<h3>General Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is the percentage ownership subject to vesting based on continued participation in the business?</li>
<li>If one founder leaves, does the company or the other founder have the right to buy back that founder’s shares? At what price?=</li>
<li>What salaries (if any), are the founders entitled to? How can that be changed?</li>
<li>How are key decisions and day-to-day decisions of the business to be made?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Basic Legal Definitions</h3>

<p>Harroch&rsquo;s article also explores numerous basic legal terms associated with launching a startup, all of which you and your business partner should familiarize yourselves with.</p>

<ul>
<li>Confidentiality Agreements &ndash; These are also referred to as Non-Disclosure Agreements or NDAs. The purpose of the agreement is to allow the holder of confidential information to share it with a third party.</li>
<li>Copyright &ndash; A copyright gives the owner the exclusive right to make copies of the work and to prepare derivative works (such as sequels or revisions) based on the work.</li>
<li>General Partnership &ndash; If there is more than one founder, a general partnership is often chosen as the legal form of business entity.</li>
<li>Patent &ndash; A patent gives its inventor the right to prevent others from making, using, or selling the patented subjected matter described in words in the patent’s claims.</li>
<li>Service marks &ndash; Service marks resemble trademarks and are used to identify services.</li>
<li>Tax Incentive &ndash; Depending on the nature of the business, various tax incentives may be available, such as renewable energy tax credits and investment tax credits.</li>
<li>Trademark &ndash; A trademark right protects the symbolic value of a word, name, symbol, or device that the trademark owner used to identify or distinguish its good from those of others.</li>
<li>Trade Secret &ndash; A trade secret right allows the owner of the right to take action against anyone who breaches an agreement or confidential relationship or who steals or uses other improper means to obtain secret information.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Include a Vesting Schedule When Issuing Shares to Co-founders</h3>

<p>When you create a vesting schedule, this means that the co-founder will earn their shares over time and protects you and the company if that a co-founder leaves the company or doesn&rsquo;t pull their weight. The standard vesting period is four years, with monthly vesting of shares. Unvested shares should be subject to repurchase by the company if the co-founder leaves the company.</p>

<h3>Protect Your Valuable Intellectual Property</h3>

<p>If intellectual property is a vital element of your business, it&rsquo;s important to protect that IP during the formative stages of a company. You can address this issue by relying on patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets to protect your valuable IP. Another step you can take is requiring all co-founders and any third-party developers to assign to the company their rights in IP they created and that is utilized by the company. Doing this will help prevent trouble if a co-founder leaves the company and takes a crucial patent with them.</p>

<h1>How to Split Equity</h1>

<h3>Ideas are Valuable</h3>

<p>If you brought the original concept to the table, increase your share holdings by about 5 percent. While execution is more important in the long run, whoever conceived the original idea deserves a little extra credit.</p>

<h3>That First Step is a Doozy</h3>

<p>Bringing something of value to the company during its formative stages – like a filed patent (not a provisional), a compelling demo, an early version of the product, or something else that means much of the work towards financing or revenue is already done – you should receive a considerable part of the equity.</p>

<h3>Full Time Commitment is Expensive</h3>

<p>Bottom line, if you’re working more, then you’re risking a lot more if the project fails, which means that you are entitled to more if the project succeeds. Also, keep in mind that part-time cofounders are a big minus to someone considering an investment, so choose your partners wisely.</p>

<h3>The CEO Gets More. Always.</h3>

<p>Splitting equity equally means that no one controls the company more than anyone else. But if that’s the case, than having a CEO is useless, as well as having any form of upper management. So, whoever is the designated CEO should get another slightly more equity. If you think that’s unfair, remember that market rate for a great CEO is higher than market rate for a great CTO, which means that’s how it is everywhere.</p>

<h3>Reputation Counts</h3>

<p>If you’re a beginning entrepreneur and your partner is an experienced founder with an established reputation, they deserve more equity. If that founder has an expansive network that benefits the company, they deserve more equity. If that founder can help secure more funding for your company, they deserve more equity.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The question of equity brings out the most fundamental differences, perceptions, and values in an aspiring startup. In fact the equity question, more than any other, may strangle a young company before it can even get started. And that’s a damn good thing.&rdquo; &ndash; Dan Shapiro</p></blockquote>

<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>

<p>Yes, talking about such topics as company roles and vision and equity and the like can be uncomfortable among founders. However, these discussions are vital to a successful partnership, as well as a successful startup, and must be held before any of you invest too much time, energy, and money into a potential company. Keep in mind that whoever you decide to launch a company with, you all will have to make countless difficult decisions once your company is actually up and running. If you take nothing else from this blog post, at least follow the bit of advice below:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Choose co-founders the way you would choose a spouse. The reality is that you will, at least in the early days, spend far more time with your co-founders than your partner.&rdquo; &ndash; Danielle Newnham</p></blockquote>

				How to Contribute to Tech Community</a>

		<p>Even though Vietnam is one of the booming countries for tech talents, there is still a whole gap between top developers around the world and us. Most of the points are related to how professional we are, our collaboration skill or soft skill.</p>

<p>Being a part of the tech community, realizing a few issues, also wanting to contribute a bit, this blog post is my precious and is a part of the whole series to improve the quality of next generation of developers.</p>

<p>Below is the short list of recommended things to do to contribute to the tech community.</p>

<h2>Start by listening</h2>

<p>Walking into a project and saying “Hi, here’s what I think this project should be doing” is usually not taken as a good thing. Some projects may welcome that sort of approach, but if the project has been running a while, the chances of that attitude being embraced are small. Listening is the best way to know what the project needs.</p>

<p><strong>Join a mailing list</strong></p>

<p>For a large scale and open project or community that involve many people, communication through a mailing list is one of the most effective ways to not distract others and good for you to follow the entire discussion.</p>

<p>Some of the mailing lists I followed over the past two years.</p>

<ul>
<li>Viet Infosec</li>
<li>golang-dev</li>
<li>golang-nuts</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Follow a blog</strong></p>

<p>Elite developers blog are great knowledge sources that you should follow and learn from them. Some of the rock stars they don’t have their blog. Instead, they use Twitter for daily updates.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dave Cheney: <a href="https://dave.cheney.net">Dave Cheney | The acme of foolishness</a></li>
<li>Dan Luu: <a href="https://danluu.com">Dan Luu</a></li>
<li>Rob Pike: <a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com">command center</a></li>
<li>Golang: <a href="https://blog.golang.org">The Go Programming Language Blog</a></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2017-10-20-golang.png"></p>

<p><strong>Join online discussions via Slack or IRC</strong></p>

<p>Most of the communities have their channel to keep in touch and discuss the project or things related to the community with other members.</p>

<p>IRC is one of the most popular tools that have been used by many projects, e.g. Python, PostgreSQL, OpenStack. IRC is free software. You need to download a client and ask for the node address to log in.</p>

<p>Beside IRC, there are several modern communication platforms. They are commercial products that serve the teamwork very well. Some with a free plan has been applied to the new community: Gitter, Slack, Discord. Also, new members are always welcome there.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reactiflux: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/reactiflux">Discord</a></li>
<li>Golang: <a href="https://gophers.slack.com">Slack</a></li>
<li>Sails: <a href="https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails">balderdashy/sails &ndash; Gitter</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Some communities in Vietnam I take participation in</p>

<ul>
<li>Golang Vietnam: <a href="http://golang.org.vn">http://golang.org.vn</a></li>
<li>Ruby Vietnam: <a href="http://ruby.org.vn">http://ruby.org.vn</a></li>
<li>Grokking Engineering: <a href="http://grokking.net">http://grokking.net</a></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2017-10-20-golang-slack.png"></p>

<h2>Participating</h2>

<p><strong>Organizing events</strong></p>

<p>The event organizer is a difficult job and very time consuming, but it’s the most critical factor to keep the community alive. People might not find it necessary as it depends on the interest. During the days in 201x, more and more events were held by the various scale of organizations and companies. Some activities that you may find</p>

<ul>
<li>Technical Meetup (Golang, Ruby, Geeky, Grokking)</li>
<li>Product Meetup</li>
<li>Design Workshop</li>
<li>Mobile Day</li>
<li>Web Summit</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2017-10-20-websummit.png"></p>

<p><strong>Sponsor an Event</strong></p>

<p>Sponsoring a participant in a program can be a great way to show your support, especially when you have your friends or employees participating in that event.</p>

<p>Usual the local events are just at a small scale from 50 &ndash; 100 participants. If they are meetup or workshop event, most of their needs are a venue to organize or food and beverage or a small amount of money for operating costs.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing your knowledge</strong></p>

<p>In every event, if you can’t afford to sponsor an event or have enough time to be an organizing member, you still can give your hand to the community by sharing your thoughts, your knowledge to other people.</p>

<p><strong>Answer a question</strong>
The best way to help build the community is by helping others. Answering someone questions especially when he is just getting his feet wet is very helpful for him. I see a lot Viet Community doesn’t have that culture. They usually piss off the newbies and don’t want to give out their hands.</p>

<p><strong>Write a blog post</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve got a blog, write about your experiences with the project that you’re using. Tell about a problem you faced utilizing the software and what you did to solve it. You’ll be helping in two ways, both by helping keep the project on the minds of others around you and by creating a record for anyone else who has your problem in the future and searches the web for the answer.</p>

<h3>Contributing to Open Source</h3>

<p>Open source software (OSS) is distributed under a licensing agreement which allows computer code to be shared, viewed and modified by other users and organizations.</p>

<p>Alternatively, in slightly more user-friendly language, open source software is available for the general public to use and modify from its original design free of charge. What it means is that a piece of software can evolve and be iterated upon by other developers anywhere in the world. Ideally, this says that the software is improved over time, but it can often take plenty of exciting twists and turns with all of that evolution and can change form and shape entirely. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Diagnose a bug</strong></p>

<p>Bugs are often poorly reported. Building an attitude to help narrow down the problem make it easier for the developers to fix it. Whatever you discover, add it to the ticket in the bug system for all to see.</p>

<p><strong>Fix a bug</strong></p>

<p>Finding an interesting bug in the ticket system and try to fix it is the best practical way to contribute to the open source project. Remember to follow the guideline and during your working period, document whatever you know to help the later contributors. Write some tests if you can.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2017-10-20-issue.png"></p>

<p><strong>Write a test</strong></p>

<p>Adding the test to the open source project will help to improve the quality and make it more stable. In some cases, test cases and test suites are more like the documents for the project.</p>

<ol>
<li>Sleep is a fundamental and non-negotiable human need.</li>
<li>Sleep allows us to see the world with fresh eyes and a reinvigorated spirit.</li>
<li>We may be what we eat, but also, to be sure, we are how we sleep.</li>
<li>Exhaustion is a sign of chaos, not a badge of honor.</li>
<li>A good day starts the night before.</li>
<li>We will treat ourselves as well as we treat our smartphones, making sure we sleep until fully recharged.</li>
<li>A bedroom should be an oasis: a beautiful, relaxing escape from the demands of the day.</li>
<li>We will usher our smartphones out of the bedroom when we go to bed.</li>
<li>We will not drive if we are drowsy!</li>
<li>We will choose Ògoing-to-bed clothes,&ldquo; not to be confused with Ògoing-to-the-gym clothes.&rdquo; Pajamas, nightdresses, and even special T-shirts send a sleep-friendly signal to our bodies: time to shut down!</li>
<li>We will choose sleep over busywork.</li>
<li>When we walk through the door of our bedroom, we will leave the day–with all of its problems and unfinished business–behind.</li>

<h1>Know how to write good commit message</h1>

<blockquote><p>Source: <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/</a></p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-06-27-git-commit.png"></p>

<p>Have you ever read some repos with commit messages like above?</p>

<p>While many repositories&#8217; logs look like the former, there are exceptions. The <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master">Linux kernel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commits/master">git itself</a> are great examples. Look at <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commits/master">Spring Boot</a>, or any repository managed by <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/commits/master">Tim Pope</a>. The contributors to these repositories know that a well-crafted git commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to fellow developers (and indeed to their future selves). A diff will tell you what changed, but only the commit message can properly tell you why.</p>

<p>Being known that, a project&rsquo;s long-term success rests (among other things) on its maintainability, reviewing others commits and pull requests is also the big reason that you should write great commit messages.</p>

<p>In the post, the author wants to address the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history: how to write an individual commit message. You can checkout the source article or just follow the <strong>seven rules</strong> below and you&rsquo;re on your way to committing like a pro</p>

<ol>
<li>Separate subject from body with a blank line</li>
<li>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</li>
<li>Capitalize the subject line</li>
<li>Do not end the subject line with a period</li>
<li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line</li>
<li>Wrap the body at 72 characters</li>
<li>Use the body to explain what and why vs. how</li>
</ol>


<h1>Git branching model</h1>

<h1>Gitflow</h1>

<p>Inspired by Vincent Driessen&rsquo;s branching model, git-flow are a set of git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for it. Git-flow is a merge based solution. It doesn&rsquo;t rebase feature branches.</p>

<p>Note: Maybe after working for a long time with merge based Gitflow, you will find your git log a little bit confusing and look like that:</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-06-27-gitflow-mess.png"></p>

<p>Please take no worries about this, because there is still a part about <code>git rebase</code>. For now, you can continue to read the article <a href="http://endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful">GitFlow considered harmful</a> to know more about the author issue.</p>

<h3>Gitflow pitfall</h3>

<ul>
<li>It makes the project&rsquo;s history completely unreadable with the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9069061/what-is-the-difference-between-git-merge-and-git-merge-no-ff"><code>--no-ff</code> flag</a>. The &mdash;no-ff flag prevents git merge from executing a &ldquo;fast-forward&rdquo; if it detects that your current HEAD is an ancestor of the commit you&rsquo;re trying to merge. A fast-forward is when, instead of constructing a merge commit, git just moves your branch pointer to point at the incoming commit.</li>
<li>The master/develop split is redundant.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s needlessly complex. And people make mistakes and break them by accident.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Anti-gitflow</h3>

<ul>
<li>There is only one eternal branch &ndash; you can call it master, develop, current, next &ndash; whatever. I personally like &ldquo;master&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s the name I&rsquo;ll use in the rest of the description, as it&rsquo;s convention by now in the Git world and immediately conveys its purpose.</li>
<li>All other branches (feature, release, hotfix, and whatever else you need) are temporary and only used as a convenience to share code with other developers and as a backup measure. They are always removed once the changes present on them land on master.</li>
<li>Features are integrated onto the master branch primarily in a way which keeps the history linear. You have a lot of leeway in how you want to enforce this. You can make it simply a convention that developers are encouraged, but not forced, to follow. On the other side of the spectrum, if you use something like Gerrit to manage your Git repositories (which I recommend, even if you don&rsquo;t practice code reviews &ndash; the permission system is fantastic, and if you ever decide you want code reviews, it&rsquo;ll be very easy to start doing them), you can set up permissions in such a way that actually forbids pushing merge commits to master, and that way ensure linear history.</li>
<li>Releases are done similarly to in GitFlow. You create a new branch for the release, branching off at the point in master that you decide has all the necessary features. From then on new work, aimed for the next release, is pushed to master as always, and any necessary changes are pushed to the release branch (in my opinion, it&rsquo;s an anti-pattern and a huge red flag if your release requires separate commits to work, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another article &ndash; for simplicity, let&rsquo;s assume you can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t want to change that). Finally, once the release is ready, you tag the top of the release branch. Then, because there is one eternal branch, there is only one way to get your release to be versioned permanently &ndash; and that is to merge the release branch into master and push that changed master. After that, all the changes that were made during the release are now part of master, and the release branch is deleted.</li>
<li>Hotfixes are very similar to releases, except you don&rsquo;t branch from an arbitrary commit on master, but from the release tag that you want to make the fix in. Again, work on master continues as always, and the necessary fixes are pushed to the hotfix branch. Once the fix is ready, the procedure is exactly the same as for a release &ndash; tag the top of the branch creating a new release, merge it into master, then delete the hotfix branch.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Pull Request</h1>

<p>Pull request is a feature that makes it easier for developers to collaborate. Pull request is a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. Some tricks to make Pull Requests more awesome for your project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open a Pull Request as early as possible: Pull Requests are a great way to start a conversation of a feature, so start one as soon as possible- even before you are finished with the code. Your team can comment on the feature as it evolves, instead of providing all their feedback at the very end.</li>
<li>Pull Requests work branch to branch: No one has a fork of github/github. We make Pull Requests in the same repository by opening Pull Requests for branches.</li>
<li>A Pull Request doesn&rsquo;t have to be merged: Pull Requests are easy to make and a great way to get feedback and track progress on a branch. But some ideas don&rsquo;t make it. It&rsquo;s okay to close a Pull Request without merging; we do it all the time.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hint: Based on an article <a href="http://ben.balter.com/2015/12/08/types-of-pull-requests/">Type of Pull Request</a>, there are 6 types of PR. But <a href="http://ben.straub.cc/2015/04/02/wip-pull-request/"><code>WIP pattern</code></a> is the one that is using by lots of teams and companies. It follows the mantra of &ldquo;<strong>Open a Pull Request as early as possible</strong>&rdquo;.</p>

<h1>Doing Code Review</h1>

<blockquote><p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review">https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review</a></p></blockquote>

<h3>Everyone</h3>

<ul>
<li>Accept that many programming decisions are opinions. Discuss tradeoffs, which you prefer, and reach a resolution quickly.</li>
<li>Ask questions; don&rsquo;t make demands. (&ldquo;What do you think about naming this :user_id?&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Ask for clarification. (&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand. Can you clarify?&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Avoid selective ownership of code. (&ldquo;mine&rdquo;, &ldquo;not mine&rdquo;, &ldquo;yours&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Avoid using terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits. (&ldquo;dumb&rdquo;, &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;). Assume everyone is attractive, &ndash; intelligent, and well-meaning.</li>
<li>Be explicit. Remember people don&rsquo;t always understand your intentions online.</li>
<li>Be humble. (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure &ndash; let&rsquo;s look it up.&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use hyperbole. (&ldquo;always&rdquo;, &ldquo;never&rdquo;, &ldquo;endlessly&rdquo;, &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use sarcasm.</li>
<li>Keep it real. If emoji, animated gifs, or humor aren&rsquo;t you, don&rsquo;t force them. If they are, use them with aplomb.</li>
<li>Talk synchronously (e.g. chat, screensharing, in person) if there are too many &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand&rdquo; or &ldquo;Alternative solution:&rdquo; comments. Post a follow-up comment summarizing the discussion.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Having Your Code Reviewed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Be grateful for the reviewer&rsquo;s suggestions. (&ldquo;Good call. I&rsquo;ll make that change.&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t take it personally. The review is of the code, not you.</li>
<li>Explain why the code exists. (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like that because of these reasons. Would it be more clear if I rename this class/file/&ndash; method/variable?&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Extract some changes and refactorings into future tickets/stories.</li>
<li>Link to the code review from the ticket/story. (&ldquo;Ready for review: <a href="https://github.com/organization/project/pull/1">https://github.com/organization/project/pull/1</a>&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Push commits based on earlier rounds of feedback as isolated commits to the branch. Do not squash until the branch is ready &ndash; to merge. Reviewers should be able to read individual updates based on their earlier feedback.</li>
<li>Seek to understand the reviewer&rsquo;s perspective.</li>
<li>Try to respond to every comment.</li>
<li>Wait to merge the branch until Continuous Integration tells you the test suite is green in the &ndash; branch.</li>
<li>Merge once you feel confident in the code and its impact on the project.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Reviewing code</h3>

<p>Understand why the change is necessary (fixes a bug, improves the user experience, refactors the existing code). Then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Communicate which ideas you feel strongly about and those you don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Identify ways to simplify the code while still solving the problem.</li>
<li>If discussions turn too philosophical or academic, move the discussion offline to a regular Friday afternoon technique &ndash; discussion. In the meantime, let the author make the final decision on alternative implementations.</li>
<li>Offer alternative implementations, but assume the author already considered them. (&ldquo;What do you think about using a custom &ndash; validator here?&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Seek to understand the author&rsquo;s perspective.</li>
<li>Sign off on the pull request with a 👍 or &ldquo;Ready to merge&rdquo; comment.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Git templates</h1>

<p>To make things easier, we have adopted Issue template and Pull Request template that we think they are great to help the team to improve the productivity</p>

		<h2>Homebrew</h2>

<p>Homebrew (or brew) is one of the biggest repo on Github with more than 29k stars, 14k forks and 1k watches. It was started by Max Howell in 2009 to build the missing package manager for OS X. Back to before 2009, in Mac OSX, if we wanted to install something, we had to install it via pkg files or bin files. We didn&rsquo;t have anything fancy like <code>apt-get</code> in Ubuntu or <code>yum</code> in Fedora. MacPort was an only option but it was not too good. Check the very old article about it: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/25/homebrew-the-perfect-gift-for-command-line-lovers/">Homebrew, the perfect gift for command line lovers</a></p>

<p>For now, you can access homebrew via</p>

<ul>
<li>Homepage: <a href="http://brew.sh">http://brew.sh</a></li>
<li>Github: <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew">https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew</a></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-03-13-homebrew.png"></p>

<p>To install homebrew, you just need to run the ruby script and you will get <code>brew</code> command ready in couple of minutes.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Homebrew is developed in Ruby and its program will be defined as a formula which is simple Ruby script. Most of tools can be found in Homebrew such as: docker, ruby, python, ansible, todo.txt, &hellip; At this time they have over 3k5 formulas that was contributed by community.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class Wget &lt; Formula
</span><span class='line'>  homepage "https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"
</span><span class='line'>  url "https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.15.tar.gz"
</span><span class='line'>  sha256 "52126be8cf1bddd7536886e74c053ad7d0ed2aa89b4b630f76785bac21695fcd"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  def install
</span><span class='line'>    system "./configure", "--prefix=#{prefix}"
</span><span class='line'>    system "make", "install"
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Simple use cases for Homebrew after you got it:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>// $FORMULA is the name of your formula
</span><span class='line'>$ brew install $FORMULA</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Brew makes it really easy to update and upgrade. Because everything is based on Git, you just need to run those below commands then everything will be done automatically.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ brew update
</span><span class='line'>$ brew upgrade</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>How to contribute to Homebrew</h2>

<p>Note: In this post, we just cover the command line or tool part of Homebrew. The example is taken from our <a href="https://github.com/dwarvesf/glod-cli"><strong>glod-cli</strong></a></p>

<p>When you look into the repo of Homebrew, you can easily find the doc directory in <code>homebrew/share/doc/homebrew/</code> which contains all the information. The most important file for this tutorial is the <code>Formula-Cookbook.md</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-03-13-homebrew-doc.png"></p>

<p>Basically, when you use homebrew, it will create a separate folder on your machine. Everything usually will be installed in <code>/usr/local/Cellar</code> and all formulas was stored at <code>/usr/local/Library/Formula</code>.</p>

<p>So in short, if you want to contribute a new one, you need to create a new formula in your local and submit a pull request to <code>https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew</code>.</p>

<h3>Fork from homebrew</h3>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-03-13-homebrew.png"></p>

<p>For us, we will have a repo called <code>dwarvesf/homebrew</code> which we can clone and start from there.</p>

<h3>Create new formula</h3>

<p>Make sure you have installed <code>brew</code> on your machine (you have to!) and your new formula must meets all their <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Acceptable-Formulae.md">Acceptable Formulae</a> requirements.</p>

<p>Then we can start from create a new branch (like git workflow) or not. For us we skip it and use the master branch (plot twist: we forgot to do this step)</p>

<p>We move to the step of create new formula by run the command</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ brew create &lt;URL.tar.gz&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Example for us, we use the archive url of our github repo <code>https://github.com/dwarvesf/glod-cli/archive/1.0.3.2.tar.gz</code>. You can get it by combining</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>https://github.com/&lt;YOUR REPO&gt;/archive/&lt;COMMIT SHA | TAG&gt;.tar.gz</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This command will help to create a local formula in <code>/usr/local/Library/Formula</code> and open with your default $EDITOR. You have to write a small Ruby script to <code>install</code> and <code>test</code> the formula. You can refer to other formulas to make it easier. Check out the main repo <code>https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula</code> or the forked one. If you have Go formula like us, you can easily search for more than 100 existed Go formulas. It&rsquo;s a great source for references.</p>

<p>Our formula looks like this</p>

<p>This command will help to install your formula at <code>/usr/local/Library/Formula</code>. Happy debugging until you can install it smoothly.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will need to uninstall the formula, you can use this command</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

		<p>I&rsquo;m the founder of Dwarves Foundation, a software development firm that based in South East Asia. We use both languages in production and have developed some web apps, systems using Go and Elixir.</p>

<p>First of all, I have to say both languages are great, same as the communities. They are both concurrency languages, but there are some differences in their souls.</p>

<p>If you come from the background of Python, Go take the same approach of &lsquo;manual language.&rsquo; Go is a minimal language. Go replaces the inheritance by the composition (which said by someone &ldquo;Inheritance was a bad dream that (most) people have woken up from.&rdquo;) There is no magic in Go source code. Also, with the support of &lsquo;gofmt&rsquo; (syntax formatter), it brings you the transparency of knowledge between your source code and others. You will feel no hesitation to read the source code of your friends or open source libraries in Github.</p>

<p><strong>Go is the best fit for API services and command line tool development</strong>. Go is a &lsquo;have-to-learn&rsquo; language for engineers.</p>

<p>Go brings you the feel of &lsquo;it just works&rsquo; language after years working with it in several projects. Talking a little bit more about Go web frameworks, they do have a good framework for web development: Gin, echo, goji &hellip; are the minimal one like Flask, Express or Sinatra; Beego, Revel are full-fledged or battery included frameworks like Django, Sails or Rails. However, at the end of the day, you don&rsquo;t want to use those frameworks or ORMs at all, you will just want to use built-in components of Go to build your new system. That&rsquo;s the moment when you have been enlightened to feel the minimalism of Go. &ldquo;It just works,&rdquo; the gopher in you will speak to yourself.</p>

<p>You can take reference to <a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server">mattermost</a> repository to learn more the stack of Go as API server and React for web front-end.</p>

<hr />

<p>After the long time working with Go and if you are the type of lazy developers, you will find that Go language itself isn&rsquo;t wise enough. Go makes sense outside of the web dev world. As a web developer, you still need the super fast speed, but you want something as cool as Rails, Elixir/Phoenix is good for you.</p>

<ul>
<li>Functional Programming vs. OOP (<a href="https://medium.com/@brianwill/object-oriented-programming-a-personal-disaster-1b044c2383ab">Object-Oriented Programming: A Disaster Story</a>)</li>
<li>Fault tolerance. It&rsquo;s something Go doesn&rsquo;t have. If an Erlang process (not an OS process, an Erlang process) dies, it dies. Every other process on the system is fine and Erlang has facilities to have processes monitor other processes and bring each other back up if one dies. It&rsquo;s just amazing. Absolutely beautiful.</li>
<li>Abstract Syntax Trees. The one that brings <strong>Homoiconicity</strong> which is believed to be the source of power of Lisp.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>We are soldiers. We use different guns or knives in different purposes.
At the moment, our stack is as below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Go for API server, cmd line tools, and DevOps scripts.</li>
<li>Elixir for web development.</li>
<li>Vue.js for frontend development</li>
</ul>

		<p>Continuous learning is one of my passion and I kept doing this for about 4 years. Everyday life, the knowledge bypass my brain and go thru. People write a lot of awesome stuffs on Medium, their personal blogs or HackerNews. I used to note them to Notes or Evernote before. Later I found those tools are very frustrating, hard to look up and I even did not open them again.</p>

<p>As a former CTO &amp; Tech Entrepreneur, Github is one of the most opened site of mine. With filtering and labeling features, we can easily organize our references to the articles. The labels will help you to classify the information and it&rsquo;s cool to make the search after that, easier to share with your friends, your colleagues.</p>

<p>So, I decided to note them all on Github.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-12-03-til.png"></p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p><em>&ldquo;Today I learned&rdquo;</em> is not the new idea, people around the world used different ways to implement the idea. If you have time, let google around and you can find some interesting topic on reddit or medium about this methodology. People call it by various name Today I/We learned, Today I found out &hellip; but the same concept is that you should keep yourself up and run. It&rsquo;s all about the productivity, the improvement of yourself. Improving yourself just 1% everyday and in a year you are better than 37.8 times.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-12-03-101.jpg"></p>

<p>If you are interested in this idea, you can follow the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/til">#til</a> on Twitter or making one and share your <strong>#til</strong> repo.</p>

		<h1>The developer</h1>

<p>In linux, the files start with a dot &ldquo;.&rdquo; are hidden. If you list files in the directory, they normally don&rsquo;t show up and keep them safe from the users. Because of that reason, the developer usually use it to store configurations of their tools. Those files are so called dotfiles. The first dot file for most of us is maybe the shell configuration file (.bashrc | .bash_profile)</p>

<blockquote><p>Nowsday, you can find the dotfiles everywhere in your system.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do you use git? vim?
Do you use your ssh identities to authenticate with git server?
Do you have any env configurations or even the backup from other apps?</p>

<p>We are software developer. Our machine is more like our second home. We spend more than 8 hours per day with it. I have a friend from Singapore. Last time when I was with him drunk, I asked him for who is his gf and suddenly he pointed at his laptop. What a nerd!</p>

<p>Back to the point, as a developer, we use a lot of tools and applications that need to back up.</p>

<h1>The community</h1>

<p>Years ago, people don&rsquo;t think about back up the dotfiles. Because we spend a lot of time with the shell, so most of the time, people just value their config for the shell. There are some topics around for people to show off their shell config. But this turned out a good start of the community.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=679762">Show us your .bashrc!</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=41331">Share your bashrc!</a></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9he4v/share_your_bashrc_vimrc_or_other_settings_file_i">Share your .bashrc, .vimrc, or other settings file</a></p>

<p>  <img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-11-05-allias.png"></p></li>
</ul>


<p>After a few years, technology changed really fast and bring developers lots of useful tools like homebrew, z, logcat-color, &hellip; Developers use different tech stacks and they have their own setting for the workspace. Once they change the workspace or move from machine to machine, it takes so many hours to setup again. That&rsquo;s why some guys start to think about all their dotfiles and back up their workspace config.</p>

<p>If you are new for dotfiles, you can have a quick look at: <a href="https://dotfiles.github.io.">https://dotfiles.github.io.</a> They organise most popular dotfiles for you to look at or start with. You can browse some repo to learn from the community, discover new tools for your toolbox and new tricks for the ones you already use.</p>

<h1>Mine</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m a geek and a tech entreprenuer. I&rsquo;m also the founder of Dwarves Foundation. We offer venture builder service and a strong tech team to help people build their tech company.</p>

<p>I began to care about my dotfiles for a year. You can find it around Github @ <a href="https://github.com/tieubao/dotfiles">tieubao/dotfiles</a></p>

<p>And you can find my dotfiles helpful if you are using the same stack as me:</p>

<ul>
<li>OSX user</li>
<li>Install stuffs via homebrew</li>
<li>Editor: vim (or sublime)</li>
<li>Develop backend in Golang</li>
<li>Frontend with React</li>
<li>Terminal addicted with zsh and prezto framework</li>
<li>Not another git newbie</li>
<li><p>Docker centric workflow</p>

		<p>After an interesting journey at <a href="/notes/a/cau-chuyen-khoi-nghiep-tu-lifebox-den-cloudjay-p1/">CloudJay</a>, I took a short break for a month and feel that startup life is too hard for young people but it&rsquo;s really worth to be a part startup scene. Someone said, one year to live in a startup is better than five years working in the enterprise. And I think this is correct. I need to face more problems and be able to solve them myself to be more mature.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-entrepreneur.jpg"></p>

<p>I also find that Google Golang is interesting and it might be useful for us later. I bet my investment on it and found <a href="https://golang.org.vn">Golang Vietnam</a>, a network of Golang Developers in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Based on some connections with friends in Singapore, I start asking people about other software businesses. And begin to find my first early member. I named a team <a href="https://dwarves.foundation">Dwarves Foundation</a>. Dwarf is the small and misshapen creatures in Norse Mythology that are wisdom, natural good at smithing, mining, and crafting. My plan is to provide Tech Partner service to ventures and startups.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-dwarves.jpg"></p>

<li><strong>Proactive</strong>: Pick your most productivity time to work. You need to figure out yourself what you want to do and what you want to contribute aligned to the team goal as a dwarf in the tribe. We are too busy to tell you.</li>
<li><strong>Growth and sharing</strong>: You can learn another skill from other teammates. We are happy to share it to you. And we believe that working hard and improving yourself everyday will make you paid back later. Read <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-motivate-myself-to-work-hard">this topic</a> to keep yourself motivated.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Our services</h2>

<h2>Workflow at Dwarves Foundation</h2>

<h3>For project management</h3>

<p>We use Trello with Kanban theory to organize tasks. Tasks will be flew from left list to right list. We also organize lists into Scrum steps. So this will be liked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sprint Planning</li>
<li>Current Sprint</li>
<li>In Progress</li>
<li>Blocked</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Bugs Report</li>
<li>Approved</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-trello.png"></p>

<p>For each project, we will have <em>Sprint planning meeting</em> for Project Manager to explain project details to project members. User stories will be converted into cards or tickets and added to Trello list > <strong>Sprint Planning</strong>.</p>

<p>Usually, one sprint is about 1 or 2 weeks, we have weekly meeting to break user stories into tasks and add them to list Current Sprint. It&rsquo;s also our target for this week, we have to get in done. This time, cards need to have requirement and non requirement specification. And sometimes, if this task has some special requirement that developers need to care about, the Project Manager need to add <strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-criteria.png"></p>

<p>As a customer, you are granted permission to access Trello Board to give feedback or be a tester. And most of my customers are happy with it.</p>

<p>The template for this workflow can be found at <a href="https://trello.com/b/WYgcFBgl/sprint-template">https://trello.com/b/WYgcFBgl/sprint-template</a></p>

<h3>For source code management</h3>

<p>We use <code>git</code> and GitLab. It&rsquo;s more like GitHub but for enterprise. You can have one by downloading and deploying it yourself.</p>

<p>We apply <a href="http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/">Gitflow</a> and <code>Merge Request</code> (some people may call it Pull Request) between developers to gain some benefits from it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can deliver anytime because branch <code>master</code> is always stable.</li>
<li>Quality source code: always review it after it&rsquo;s merged into branch <code>develep</code></li>
<li>High efficiency collaboration between team members.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-gitflow.png"></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another article about it on Atlassian site: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow</a></p>

<p>Project Manager will be the one that init the repository on Git with some imporatant informations. For every ticket on Trello, developers need to create one issue in GitLab, create new feature branch and start the implementation on it. The <code>git commit</code> command must attach with one or more than one issue.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-commit.png"></p>

<p>After that, one merge request will be created and the person who has responsibility to review this request need to check over the source code then <code>Accept</code> or <code>Reject</code> the <code>Merge Request</code>.</p>

<p>This card will be moved to list <code>Testing</code>, QC will be assigned to test this feature and so on.</p>

<h3>For Communication</h3>

<p>We use <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> as the main hub for all informations, from team meeting, hangout, manage tasks and source code &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-slack.png"></p>

<p>Slack support lots of methods to add integration. So the powerful it can be depends on what you integrate into it.</p>

<p>Finally, at the end of the day, we do daily meeting via hangout or face to face at the office to summary what we have done today and what we plan to do tomorrow. The project manager will be the one to write it down and make weekly report to customer.</p>

<p>All the processes out there are just to make the team stick together and development plan works. All team members need to understand their roles, team vision and know how to make things go on the right tracks.</p>
