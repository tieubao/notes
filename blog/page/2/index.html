		<h1>Ensure Alignment of Vision</h1>

<p>As you and your cofounder (or cofounders) embark on your entrepreneurial journey together, it’s imperative that you all share the same vision for the purpose and future of your company. It’s easy to get caught up in the thrill of launching a potentially successful startup together, but you all must take the time to establish the existential foundations of the company, and as early as possible, to help prevent the possibility of a drastic falling out later on.</p>

<h3>What Are Your Goals?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Why are you creating this startup?</li>
<li>What need will it fill?</li>
<li>What will your initial product/service offering be?</li>
<li>And what is your strategy for growing the company?</li>
</ul>


<h3>What Are Your Company Values and Philosophy?</h3>

<p>Your company’s success depends on vision alignment (alignment between you and your investors, your employees, and your customers, etc.). Do you share the same priorities? Do you agree on what’s most important to you both personally and for the future of your company?</p>

<h3>How Do You Measure Success?</h3>

<ul>
<li>What do you and your co-founder(s) hope to get out of this business?</li>
<li>How will you know if you’ve achieved your goals?</li>
<li>If you don’t agree on the same goals, how will you know when you’ve achieved them?</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Discussing these issues with your co-founder could get uncomfortable, create rifts, or even uncover deal-breakers. If you are able to successfully have these difficult conversations, this is a testament to your partnership and to the strength of your relationship &mdash; and will serve as a solid foundation from which to grow your business.&rdquo; &ndash; David Ehrenberg</p></blockquote>

<h3>Working Styles and Culture</h3>

<p>Once you and your cofounder have laid down the aspirational and philosophical groundwork for your startup, this is also the ideal time to determine what kind of working environment best complements the vision of your startup.</p>

<ul>
<li>What 3 words best describe the startup culture you want to create (e.g. open, hard-working, eccentric, etc.)? Pro-tip: If you’re really serious and far along go visit few office spaces together to get a sense of what each of you likes work environments wise and why.</li>
<li>What values do we want to instill in our employees?</li>
<li>If you could pick 2 things to change about our company, and two things to bring with you from your previous experience, what would they be and why?</li>
<li>How much equity are we allocating for future employees?</li>
<li>What should we look for in our first 5 hires?</li>
<li>Describe your ideal working style.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Legal Decisions &amp; Definitions</h1>

<h3>General Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is the percentage ownership subject to vesting based on continued participation in the business?</li>
<li>If one founder leaves, does the company or the other founder have the right to buy back that founder’s shares? At what price?=</li>
<li>What salaries (if any), are the founders entitled to? How can that be changed?</li>
<li>How are key decisions and day-to-day decisions of the business to be made?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Basic Legal Definitions</h3>

<p>Harroch&rsquo;s article also explores numerous basic legal terms associated with launching a startup, all of which you and your business partner should familiarize yourselves with.</p>

<ul>
<li>Confidentiality Agreements &ndash; These are also referred to as Non-Disclosure Agreements or NDAs. The purpose of the agreement is to allow the holder of confidential information to share it with a third party.</li>
<li>Copyright &ndash; A copyright gives the owner the exclusive right to make copies of the work and to prepare derivative works (such as sequels or revisions) based on the work.</li>
<li>General Partnership &ndash; If there is more than one founder, a general partnership is often chosen as the legal form of business entity.</li>
<li>Patent &ndash; A patent gives its inventor the right to prevent others from making, using, or selling the patented subjected matter described in words in the patent’s claims.</li>
<li>Service marks &ndash; Service marks resemble trademarks and are used to identify services.</li>
<li>Tax Incentive &ndash; Depending on the nature of the business, various tax incentives may be available, such as renewable energy tax credits and investment tax credits.</li>
<li>Trademark &ndash; A trademark right protects the symbolic value of a word, name, symbol, or device that the trademark owner used to identify or distinguish its good from those of others.</li>
<li>Trade Secret &ndash; A trade secret right allows the owner of the right to take action against anyone who breaches an agreement or confidential relationship or who steals or uses other improper means to obtain secret information.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Include a Vesting Schedule When Issuing Shares to Co-founders</h3>

<p>When you create a vesting schedule, this means that the co-founder will earn their shares over time and protects you and the company if that a co-founder leaves the company or doesn&rsquo;t pull their weight. The standard vesting period is four years, with monthly vesting of shares. Unvested shares should be subject to repurchase by the company if the co-founder leaves the company.</p>

<h3>Protect Your Valuable Intellectual Property</h3>

<p>If intellectual property is a vital element of your business, it&rsquo;s important to protect that IP during the formative stages of a company. You can address this issue by relying on patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets to protect your valuable IP. Another step you can take is requiring all co-founders and any third-party developers to assign to the company their rights in IP they created and that is utilized by the company. Doing this will help prevent trouble if a co-founder leaves the company and takes a crucial patent with them.</p>

<h1>How to Split Equity</h1>

<h3>Ideas are Valuable</h3>

<p>If you brought the original concept to the table, increase your share holdings by about 5 percent. While execution is more important in the long run, whoever conceived the original idea deserves a little extra credit.</p>

<h3>That First Step is a Doozy</h3>

<p>Bringing something of value to the company during its formative stages – like a filed patent (not a provisional), a compelling demo, an early version of the product, or something else that means much of the work towards financing or revenue is already done – you should receive a considerable part of the equity.</p>

<h3>Full Time Commitment is Expensive</h3>

<p>Bottom line, if you’re working more, then you’re risking a lot more if the project fails, which means that you are entitled to more if the project succeeds. Also, keep in mind that part-time cofounders are a big minus to someone considering an investment, so choose your partners wisely.</p>

<h3>The CEO Gets More. Always.</h3>

<p>Splitting equity equally means that no one controls the company more than anyone else. But if that’s the case, than having a CEO is useless, as well as having any form of upper management. So, whoever is the designated CEO should get another slightly more equity. If you think that’s unfair, remember that market rate for a great CEO is higher than market rate for a great CTO, which means that’s how it is everywhere.</p>

<h3>Reputation Counts</h3>

<p>If you’re a beginning entrepreneur and your partner is an experienced founder with an established reputation, they deserve more equity. If that founder has an expansive network that benefits the company, they deserve more equity. If that founder can help secure more funding for your company, they deserve more equity.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The question of equity brings out the most fundamental differences, perceptions, and values in an aspiring startup. In fact the equity question, more than any other, may strangle a young company before it can even get started. And that’s a damn good thing.&rdquo; &ndash; Dan Shapiro</p></blockquote>

<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>

<p>Yes, talking about such topics as company roles and vision and equity and the like can be uncomfortable among founders. However, these discussions are vital to a successful partnership, as well as a successful startup, and must be held before any of you invest too much time, energy, and money into a potential company. Keep in mind that whoever you decide to launch a company with, you all will have to make countless difficult decisions once your company is actually up and running. If you take nothing else from this blog post, at least follow the bit of advice below:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Choose co-founders the way you would choose a spouse. The reality is that you will, at least in the early days, spend far more time with your co-founders than your partner.&rdquo; &ndash; Danielle Newnham</p></blockquote>

				How to Contribute to Tech Community</a>

		<p>Even though Vietnam is one of the booming countries for tech talents, there is still a whole gap between top developers around the world and us. Most of the points are related to how professional we are, our collaboration skill or soft skill.</p>

<p>Being a part of the tech community, realizing a few issues, also wanting to contribute a bit, this blog post is my precious and is a part of the whole series to improve the quality of next generation of developers.</p>

<p>Below is the short list of recommended things to do to contribute to the tech community.</p>

<h2>Start by listening</h2>

<p>Walking into a project and saying “Hi, here’s what I think this project should be doing” is usually not taken as a good thing. Some projects may welcome that sort of approach, but if the project has been running a while, the chances of that attitude being embraced are small. Listening is the best way to know what the project needs.</p>

<p><strong>Join a mailing list</strong></p>

<p>For a large scale and open project or community that involve many people, communication through a mailing list is one of the most effective ways to not distract others and good for you to follow the entire discussion.</p>

<p>Some of the mailing lists I followed over the past two years.</p>

<ul>
<li>Viet Infosec</li>
<li>golang-dev</li>
<li>golang-nuts</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Follow a blog</strong></p>

<p>Elite developers blog are great knowledge sources that you should follow and learn from them. Some of the rock stars they don’t have their blog. Instead, they use Twitter for daily updates.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dave Cheney: <a href="https://dave.cheney.net">Dave Cheney | The acme of foolishness</a></li>
<li>Dan Luu: <a href="https://danluu.com">Dan Luu</a></li>
<li>Rob Pike: <a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com">command center</a></li>
<li>Golang: <a href="https://blog.golang.org">The Go Programming Language Blog</a></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2017-10-20-golang.png"></p>

<p><strong>Join online discussions via Slack or IRC</strong></p>

<p>Most of the communities have their channel to keep in touch and discuss the project or things related to the community with other members.</p>

<p>IRC is one of the most popular tools that have been used by many projects, e.g. Python, PostgreSQL, OpenStack. IRC is free software. You need to download a client and ask for the node address to log in.</p>

<p>Beside IRC, there are several modern communication platforms. They are commercial products that serve the teamwork very well. Some with a free plan has been applied to the new community: Gitter, Slack, Discord. Also, new members are always welcome there.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reactiflux: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/reactiflux">Discord</a></li>
<li>Golang: <a href="https://gophers.slack.com">Slack</a></li>
<li>Sails: <a href="https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails">balderdashy/sails &ndash; Gitter</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Some communities in Vietnam I take participation in</p>

<ul>
<li>Golang Vietnam: <a href="http://golang.org.vn">http://golang.org.vn</a></li>
<li>Ruby Vietnam: <a href="http://ruby.org.vn">http://ruby.org.vn</a></li>
<li>Grokking Engineering: <a href="http://grokking.net">http://grokking.net</a></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2017-10-20-golang-slack.png"></p>

<h2>Participating</h2>

<p><strong>Organizing events</strong></p>

<p>The event organizer is a difficult job and very time consuming, but it’s the most critical factor to keep the community alive. People might not find it necessary as it depends on the interest. During the days in 201x, more and more events were held by the various scale of organizations and companies. Some activities that you may find</p>

<ul>
<li>Technical Meetup (Golang, Ruby, Geeky, Grokking)</li>
<li>Product Meetup</li>
<li>Design Workshop</li>
<li>Mobile Day</li>
<li>Web Summit</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2017-10-20-websummit.png"></p>

<p><strong>Sponsor an Event</strong></p>

<p>Sponsoring a participant in a program can be a great way to show your support, especially when you have your friends or employees participating in that event.</p>

<p>Usual the local events are just at a small scale from 50 &ndash; 100 participants. If they are meetup or workshop event, most of their needs are a venue to organize or food and beverage or a small amount of money for operating costs.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing your knowledge</strong></p>

<p>In every event, if you can’t afford to sponsor an event or have enough time to be an organizing member, you still can give your hand to the community by sharing your thoughts, your knowledge to other people.</p>

<p><strong>Answer a question</strong>
The best way to help build the community is by helping others. Answering someone questions especially when he is just getting his feet wet is very helpful for him. I see a lot Viet Community doesn’t have that culture. They usually piss off the newbies and don’t want to give out their hands.</p>

<p><strong>Write a blog post</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve got a blog, write about your experiences with the project that you’re using. Tell about a problem you faced utilizing the software and what you did to solve it. You’ll be helping in two ways, both by helping keep the project on the minds of others around you and by creating a record for anyone else who has your problem in the future and searches the web for the answer.</p>

<h3>Contributing to Open Source</h3>

<p>Open source software (OSS) is distributed under a licensing agreement which allows computer code to be shared, viewed and modified by other users and organizations.</p>

<p>Alternatively, in slightly more user-friendly language, open source software is available for the general public to use and modify from its original design free of charge. What it means is that a piece of software can evolve and be iterated upon by other developers anywhere in the world. Ideally, this says that the software is improved over time, but it can often take plenty of exciting twists and turns with all of that evolution and can change form and shape entirely. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Diagnose a bug</strong></p>

<p>Bugs are often poorly reported. Building an attitude to help narrow down the problem make it easier for the developers to fix it. Whatever you discover, add it to the ticket in the bug system for all to see.</p>

<p><strong>Fix a bug</strong></p>

<p>Finding an interesting bug in the ticket system and try to fix it is the best practical way to contribute to the open source project. Remember to follow the guideline and during your working period, document whatever you know to help the later contributors. Write some tests if you can.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2017-10-20-issue.png"></p>

<p><strong>Write a test</strong></p>

<p>Adding the test to the open source project will help to improve the quality and make it more stable. In some cases, test cases and test suites are more like the documents for the project.</p>

<p>Liên lạc với bọn mình qua email <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x74;&#x65;&#97;&#109;&#64;&#x64;&#x77;&#x61;&#x72;&#x76;&#x65;&#115;&#x66;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">&#116;&#x65;&#97;&#x6d;&#x40;&#100;&#119;&#97;&#114;&#x76;&#x65;&#115;&#102;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a> | Title: &ldquo;Be an awesome dwarf&rdquo; kèm lời giới thiệu về bạn</p>

<hr />

<h1>Tuổi trẻ Khởi nghiệp</h1>

<p>Người đang nói chuyện với các bạn là một trong những thành viên đầu tiên của team Dwarves Foundation. Dwarves Foundation là một startup được thành lập từ cuối năm 2014, đầu năm 2015 với niềm tin và niềm tự hào vào High Engineering Culture, thứ philosophy mà mình tin sẽ góp phần tạo nên thế hệ lập trình viên ưu tú, là những người theo đuổi và có ảnh hưởng trực tiếp vào những phát minh tiếp theo của thế giới Internet. Các công nghệ và sản phẩm nổi bật hiện tại đã nói lên điều này. Sẽ không có Facebook &ndash; Connecting the World, GotIt &ndash; Organizing the World’s Brainpower, Bitcoin / Ethereum &ndash; Decentralized Economy &hellip; nếu không có đóng góp của các lập trình viên.</p>

<p>Ở Dwarves Foundation bọn mình không có những lời hứa hẹn. Ở đây bọn mình đang xây dựng nên một môi trường năng động, tạo nên những khác biệt mà các team tech khác không thể nào có được, nhất là khi môi trường ngoài kia các công ty đối xử với developer như &ldquo;thợ xây cao cấp&rdquo;. Những thành viên ở Dwarves Foundation đang viết nên những kỳ tích như 108 Lương Sơn, như Thục Hán lập quốc.</p>

<p>Ở đây bọn mình không chơi với những dự án &ldquo;ăn xổi ở thì&rdquo; hay làm cho nhanh gọn &ldquo;giao hàng&rdquo; rồi thoát. Ở đây bọn mình làm việc cùng các founders và entrepreneurs, đến từ khắp nơi, của nhiều dự án sáng tạo mang tính đột phá. Ông nào cũng muốn disrupt thị trường mới chịu. Nhưng để góp phần làm được điều đó, bọn mình phải theo đuổi world-class quality. Các câu hỏi để phát triển bản thân và làm sao nâng cao chất lượng công việc luôn là chủ đề chính trong các cuộc tranh luận.</p>

<h1>Prerequise</h1>

<p>Yêu cầu cơ bản cần từ bạn là tự tin vào bản thân, tiếng Anh cơ bản là cần thiết (tiếng Anh siêu hơn thì càng tốt), làm được việc và hòa hợp được với mọi người. Bạn sẽ là người phù hợp nếu bạn mong muốn được đóng góp sự sáng tạo vào công việc, được ghi nhận và làm chủ công việc của mình. Lợi ích của bạn song hành cùng lợi ích của team. Live long and prosper 🖖</p>

<h1>Team</h1>

<p>Bạn sẽ làm việc cùng ai? Team hiện tại khoảng 15 thành viên, độ tuổi trung bình 25, chủ yếu xuất thân từ các trường Đại học trong cả nước như CNTT, Tự Nhiên, Bách Khoa, Ngoại Thương&hellip; và bạn sẽ làm việc với 15 bạn này để cùng nhau đóng góp và phát triển thế hệ tiếp theo.</p>

<p>Bọn mình hiện đang offer range lương <strong>từ 7tr đến 25tr/tháng</strong> tùy theo khả năng và sự đóng góp cho việc xây dựng đế chế này. Các options về shares sẽ luôn được cân nhắc cho những thành viên xuất sắc hoặc sau khi chúng ta gặp mặt và làm việc cùng nhau. Live long and prosper 🖖</p>

<p>Team based ở Saigon nên các bạn từ 3 miền nếu muốn Nam tiến xây dựng sự nghiệp thì liên hệ bọn mình để nhận được hỗ trợ nhé.

</ul>


<h1>Tái bút: Những thứ bọn mình đang làm</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Automation: Tự động hóa các bước trong quy trình phát triển và triển khai phần mềm: Bạn nghe qua về CI/CD workflow, from idea to production philosophy? hay vertical scaling and horizontal scaling chưa? Bọn mình đang xây dựng những thứ này với Docker trên các nền tảng DC/OS | Kubernetes | AWS</p></li>
<li><p>Sản phẩm thứ nhất (codename DFUB) là một platform giúp tự động hóa việc vận chuyển đơn đặt hàng bằng cách liên kết tất cả các eCommerce Systems (Magento, WooCommerce, Shopify, eBay, Amazon &hellip;) và các Carriers (DHL, UPS, FedEx &hellip;). Thử tưởng tượng bạn là chủ một cái shop, sau khi khách lên đặt hàng hệ thống tự tìm bên vận chuyển, chọn giá vận chuyển thấp nhất cho bạn, bạn chỉ việc ngồi chờ bên vận chuyển &ldquo;đến thăm nhà&rdquo; (Sướng chưa 😬). Sản phẩm đang phát triển trong giai đoạn đầu và dự tính sẽ launch vào cuối năm nay ở SG và Malay.</p></li>
<li><p>Sản phẩm thứ hai (codename DFCL) là một mạng xã hội nghề nghiệp như LinkedIn với việc tập trung khai thác các mối quan hệ giữa ứng viên và người giới thiệu, nhằm giúp người tuyển dụng có thể lựa chọn được ứng viên phù hợp nhất. Sản phẩm đang ở giữa giai đoạn phát triển và dự tính sẽ launch vào tháng 10 năm nay ở UK.</p></li>
<li><p>Sản phẩm thứ ba (codename DFAM) là một mobile platform phục vụ trong lĩnh vực bất động sản. Với việc tập trung vào các thuật toán xếp hạng thông minh dựa vào độ liên quan, địa điểm,  và sở thích của user, mặc khác cung cấp công cụ thể Real Estate broker có thể tạo một profile riêng cho mình trên đó, sản phẩm đang được đầu tư hơi bị nhiều chất xám và passion tuổi trẻ. Gần đây mình có post một bài liên quan đến product này trên Golang Vietnam: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/golang.org.vn/posts/1459227294376272">https://www.facebook.com/golang.org.vn/posts/1459227294376272</a></p></li>

		<h1>Vấn đề của tuổi trẻ</h1>

<p>Sau hơn 27 năm sống trên quả đất này, học và tiếp thu một khối lượng kiến thức đồ sộ; trong đó là 5 năm ra đời, sinh hoạt và làm việc dưới nhiều vai trò trong cộng đồng đi từ thực tập, fresher là một đứa trắng tinh mơ lên đến Lead Engineer, Giám đốc Kỹ thuật rồi đến Giám đốc Điều hành kiêm luôn sales và growth của một công ty công nghệ nho nhỏ, chuyên xây dựng các platform, sản phẩm, ứng dụng cho nhiều công ty startups trên thế giới; tiếp xúc với rất nhiều người từ đủ mọi tầng lớp; làm mọi việc từ lợi nhuận đến phi lợi nhuận, culi cho đến điều hành; làm việc cùng đủ loại đối tác từ Tây đến Ta &hellip; mình xin note lại vài dòng dưới đây như là lời chia sẻ và định hướng cho các bạn trẻ hơn hoặc lớn hơn, đang tham gia làm việc cùng mình hoặc không làm việc cùng mình.</p>

<p>Bài viết được chia làm nhiều phần, trong đó phần đầu tiên mình sẽ tập trung đi vào vấn đề chung của các bạn trẻ, góc nhìn cuộc đời của bạn bè, người thân, đồng nghiệp &hellip; Những vấn đề được nêu bên dưới hầu như không phân chia tuổi tác. Nếu cuộc đời là một tựa game thì người chơi trong game không phân biệt tuổi tác, kinh nghiệm cũng chỉ mang tính tương đối, chơi dở hay chơi giỏi, vượt qua các chướng ngại dễ dàng hay không là do kỹ năng.</p>

<p>Danh sách bài viết:</p>

<ol>
<li>Vấn đề của tuổi trẻ</li>
<li>Vấn đề xin việc và cho việc</li>
<li>Sống có mục tiêu</li>
</ol>


<h1>Vấn đề chung của xã hội</h1>

<p>Bản chất con người là tổng hòa các mối quan hệ xã hội. Hay gọn hơn &ldquo;Con người là sản phẩm của xã hội&rdquo;. Có nhiều câu nói đùa như: &ldquo;Tôi là sản phẩm hoàn hảo của chế độ X&rdquo;. Câu nói này mang ý nghĩa trung lập, không khen cũng không chê, phụ thuộc hoàn toàn vào suy nghĩ người đọc. Việc các bạn trẻ được sinh ra và lớn lên ở đâu, trong một xã hội pháp quyền với sự giáo dục của chế độ tại nơi đó sẽ ảnh hưởng rất lớn đến suy nghĩ và hệ thống niềm tin của các bạn.</p>

<h2>Sự bảo bọc &amp; Các cột mốc cuộc đời</h2>

<p>Mặc định các bạn lớn lên ở các gia đình ở thành thị được gia đình và xã hội định sẵn một số mốc sau đây</p>

<ul>
<li>Từ 0 &ndash; 5 tuổi: Học Mẫu giáo</li>
<li>Từ 6 &ndash; 18 tuổi: Học kiến thức phổ thông</li>
<li>Từ 19 &ndash; 22 tuổi: Học Đại học hoặc Cao đẳng</li>
<li>Từ 22 &ndash; 30 tuổi: Bắt đầu tham gia vào xã hội, tìm việc làm và trở thành người lớn.</li>
<li>Từ 30 trở đi mình sẽ để ở một bài khác.</li>
</ul>


<p>Từ sau đó trở đi việc tiếp tục sống cuộc sống như thế nào là một ẩn số, không còn ai có thể bày cho bạn được như thời còn sống trong vòng tay của bố mẹ được. Tuổi 22 là một độ tuổi quan trọng. Từ tuổi trở đi coi như bắt đầu một mốc đặc biệt của cuộc đời, bạn tham gia vào sự vận hành xã hội với vai trò một cá thể độc lập. Lần đầu tiên bạn nhận được câu hỏi: &ldquo;Định hướng sau này của mày là gì? Sau này mày muốn làm gì?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mấy bạn trai ở độ tuổi này lại càng thê thảm hơn. Bạn nào mà có bạn gái bằng tuổi thì ôi thôi xác định, những câu hỏi về định hướng cuộc đời từ bạn gái cứ thế mà đập vào nhau xong đập thẳng vào mặt cậu bạn trai. Trả lời không được hoặc không thực hiện &ldquo;kịp thời gian&rdquo; thì cũng xác định luôn.</p>

<p>Nói ra để thấy nếu các bạn có cùng góc nhìn ít nhất là đến khúc này hoặc hướng cho cuộc đời mình theo kịch bản trên này thì chúc mừng, bạn nằm trong danh sách gặp các vấn đề chung rồi đó.</p>

<p>Đa số các gia đình kha khá một chút đều có định hướng sẵn cho con cháu. Từ việc học, việc nhà, chọn chỗ làm, lớn lên lúc nào bố mẹ còn sống thì mày cứ an tâm. Các bạn này thì sướng lắm. All the good times. But good times create weak men. Weak men create hard time. Khi nào đến hard time thì không nói được. Nói như mấy bạn hater thì Karma will hit you, bitch.</p>

<h2>Thiếu kỹ năng</h2>

<p>Khoảng này đối với giới trẻ trí thức thì mình cũng không có nhiều lời lắm. Hệ thống giáo dục hiện tại nếu bạn học chăm chỉ thì bảo đảm có kỹ năng. Thợ giỏi ở Việt Nam có, chỉ là chưa nhiều. Điển hình nhất là ngành Công nghệ Thông tin xuất khẩu engineers đi ầm ầm. Các bạn code như máy, chỉ có điều đa số khi được hỏi đến sẽ không biết mình muốn xây dựng những gì thôi. Chủ đề này thì báo chí nói muôn đời. Thi cử quốc tế giải nhiều nấm sau mưa, không thua nước nào cả, có điều không biết để làm gì. Những bạn lười học thì mình không nói đến. Chúng ta cần những người hiểu được ý nghĩa của việc mình đang làm, suy nghĩ phản biện để tìm ra cái tốt hơn là chỉ biết cắm đầu làm theo lời người khác.</p>

<p>Con bé Nhiên, gấu của thằng Tùng, nó hỏi mình, nếu ai cũng làm thầy hết thì ai làm thợ anh ơi? Mình không trả lời mà dành câu đố cho các bạn đó? Trả lời được coi như hiểu được dòng chảy lịch sử văn minh nhân loại 😌</p>

<h2>Thiếu tầm nhìn</h2>

<p>Góc nhìn hạn hẹp, sống trong thế giới quan do bản thân vẽ ra. Từ chối tìm hiểu các kiến thức cần thiết và kĩ năng sống cần thiết. Không cảm giác việc tìm hiểu thế giới xung quanh là quan trọng lắm, sống trong thế giới của riêng mình là quá đủ rồi. Việc nhận định như vậy đang là thiếu tầm nhìn và không có cái nhìn tổng quát rồi. Đối với các bạn đang có suy nghĩ như vậy thì mình không có ý định tranh cãi hay khuyên nhủ gì cả. Dòng chảy của xã hội là một chuỗi các quy luật đè lên nhau, những tác động sẽ ít bao giờ là trực tiếp như có đứa nào ghét lại đấm vào mặt bạn; mà sẽ tác động một cách gián tiếp hơn.</p>

<p>Việc thiếu cái nhìn tổng quát về những gì đang diễn ra rất tai hại. Những tác hại này khi bạn cảm nhận được thì thường vô phương cứu chữa rồi.</p>

<p>Ví như việc cách đây vài năm, giá xăng tăng mỗi kì lên 1000, nhiều anh chị thi nhau post status: &ldquo;Biết vậy nãy về chạy ra đổ đầy bình&rdquo;. Mình nhìn mà phải thốt lên đầy bình WTF?! Việc thiếu kiến thức và thiếu cái nhìn tổng quát chỉ cho bạn biết được bạn bị lỗ vài nghìn; mà không biết là sau đó kéo theo một loạt thứ khác tăng giá do chi phí vận chuyển, thuế và các phí khác sẽ tăng theo, giá nhập khẩu sẽ tăng theo, cùng lượng tiền mua được ít thứ hơn, trong khi lương bạn thì không tăng.</p>

<h2>Thiếu định hướng</h2>

<p>Nói ra chắc bạn bè mình không tin, từng có một giai đoạn năm 20 tuổi mình rơi vào khủng hoảng trầm trọng sau khi chia tay bạn gái. Chuyện tình yêu mình xin bàn ở một bài khác. Riêng ở giai đoạn buồn ơi là buồn đó, mình vô tình rơi vào cảnh mỗi ngày thức dậy không biết làm gì một cách tích cực. Suy nghĩ &ldquo;Làm gì cho hết ngày bây giờ?&rdquo; cứ lẫn quẩn mãi ở trong đầu cho đến khi hết ngày. Đây là một trong những trải nghiệm mà đến bây giờ mình đánh giá thuộc loại thú vị nhất.</p>

<p>Đây là cảm giác trỗng rỗng tận cùng của việc mất định hướng, nếu đã từng một lần xuống được tới đây rồi thì xin chúc mừng bạn. Điều này là tiền đề cho mọi nỗ lực của bạn sau này. Nó giống như kiểu người sắp mất đi tánh mạng với biết quý giá mạng sống và sức khỏe của mình; người đã từng sống trong nghèo khổ mới biết quý giá và tôn trọng của cải, vật chất.</p>

<p>Mình có một thằng bạn tên Anh, thuộc loại trâu bò, chơi với nhau, học cùng với nhau mấy năm trời từ cấp 2 đến cấp 3, lúc nào nó cũng giỏi hơn, phong cách hơn, nhạy hơn. Đời xui khiến sao lên đại học mình vào Công nghệ Thông tin còn nó thì chọn Vật lý. Ra trường công việc của ngành không mang lại đủ thu nhập làm nó cảm thấy chán nản. Nhiều tuần tìm hướng đi mới nhưng rồi cũng rơi vào cảnh như mình ở trên. &ldquo;Làm gì cho hết ngày bây giờ?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nếu bạn chưa từng đến được tận cùng thì cũng không sao, thiếu một chút trải nghiệm thôi chứ cũng không sao. Đừng buồn.</p>

<p>Định hướng là mục tiêu xác định ở phía trước. Sống có định hướng của bạn, do bạn đề ra ở đây khác với loại định hướng do người khác vẽ ra cho bạn mà mình có đề cập ở phần trên.</p>

<h2>Không hiểu luật chơi</h2>

<p>Những kiến thức về cuộc sống, xã hội, cách đối nhân xử thế &hellip; là những thứ hiện tại chúng ta không được dạy. Các bài Đạo Đức học hiện tại được các giáo viên chương trình giáo dục phổ thông lược bớt. Các kiến thức về luật pháp, kinh tế và chính trị nói chung không được phổ biến rộng rãi. Điều này thật sự tai hại.</p>

<p>Là một sản phẩm của xã hội như trên, các bạn không hiểu các luật của xã hội được tạo ra như thế nào, các thành phần tham gia vào xã hội; ai là người nắm quyền; tiền từ đâu mà ra và sự lưu hành của đồng tiền trong xã hội đang như thế nào. Các bạn không hiểu được đồng tiền là công cụ và đơn giản hơn là các bạn không biết cách để tạo ra tiền; tại sao người khác phải trả tiền cho bạn và các bạn không hiểu bản chất của sự giàu có. Điều này mình cho là điều căn bản nhất mà chương trình giáo dục không dạy cho các bạn.</p>

<p>Việc thiếu hiểu biết về thứ công cụ này làm các bạn sinh ra suy nghĩ lệch lạc: tiền là mục tiêu lớn nhất của cuộc đời bạn và từng quyết định, hành động hay các mối quan hệ đều có khả năng quy đổi qua tiền.</p>

<p>Nếu cuộc sống là một tựa game, việc hiểu luật của game để có thể chơi game một cách dễ dàng nhất là một điều thực sự cần thiết. Trong các bài sau mình sẽ bàn về những góc nhìn khác về các vấn đề trên, cùng một số kiến thức mà mình thu nhặt được từ khắp nơi, được dạy bảo từ các thế hệ đi trước &hellip;</p>

		<p>This article is one of my favorites about company culture. At <a href="http://dwarvesf.com">Dwarves Foundation</a>, we pursue the path of high tech Ventures Builder where we can be the foundation for all tech startups for now and even for Industry 4.0. Building the culture for engineer team is the highest priority.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3040723/12-signs-your-company-has-an-enviable-workplace-culture">fastcompany</a></p>

<p>Many years ago I worked for a small organization that was effecting change on a national level. It was known for excellence, vision, and world-class leadership. It had a clear mission and strategy. With my acceptance into this organization came the respect of my friends and family for the achievement of such an honor.</p>

<p>But within a few months, I began to realize the department where I was placed did not represent the values of the overall organization. The leadership was more interested in saving face than making decisions based on integrity. Staff members talked about one another in highly negative terms. Complaining and whining were the most common modes of communication. There was little respect for the contribution of others on the team.</p>

<p>A friend and I tried to swing things back to a positive place, but we were sarcastically branded &ldquo;Danny and Darla Do-Right&rdquo; since we wouldn’t participate in the negativity. Efforts to make central leadership aware of the toxic nature of the culture were directed back to department leadership—which, of course, was where the problems began. The department completely fractured toward the end of our assignment, and most team members left the organization hurt and disillusioned. Richard Dore, the director of Proteus Leadership Centres, explains what happened this way:</p>

<blockquote><p>Having a great workplace culture can appear to be rare—and creating one is elusive and near impossible for some managers. People are often frustrated by their culture, with some describing their workplace as being dominated by negative and toxic personalities, with underhanded and manipulative infighting that stifles growth, innovation and results.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is nothing worse than working in an organization that has a bad culture. It doesn’t matter how much money you make or how many weeks of vacation you are given; when you work in a toxic environment, you still come home tense and stressed at the end of each day. And that isn’t worth it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is nothing better than working at an organization with a great culture. You wake up every day looking forward to getting back to work on the mission with people you enjoy being around.</p>

<p>I’m sure this list isn’t exhaustive, but here are twelve signs that a great culture exists in your organization or company:</p>

<h3>1. PEOPLE ARE WAITING IN LINE TO JOIN YOUR TEAM</h3>

<p>It’s not because you are offering more money than they could find somewhere else. Many times the pay is less. But people have heard about your team, and they would give anything to be a part of it.</p>

<h3>2. TURNOVER IS LOW</h3>

<p>You should especially pay attention to this in entry-level and mid-level jobs. Often top leaders will stay forever because it’s safe and the pay is good. But if you see people staying for an unexpectedly long time in facility care or accounting, you are probably looking at a healthy culture.</p>

<h3>3. TOP LEADERS ARE NOT INSECURE ABOUT OTHER LEADERS SUCCEEDING</h3>

<p>In fact, they encourage it.</p>

<h3>4. GOSSIP ISN’T TOLERATED</h3>

<p>It isn’t just the leaders calling for people to take the high road in their communication. At every level, gossip is shut down with an encouragement to speak directly to the individual.</p>

<h3>5. LATERAL LEADERSHIP IS OUTSTANDING</h3>

<p>Leading people below you is easy. That is, it’s easy compared to leading people next to you over whom you have no authority. A great culture sees people coming alongside their peers to encourage, or occasionally to correct and redirect.</p>

<h3>6. TEAM MEMBERS ARE ENERGIZED BY THE MISSION</h3>

<p>You hear leaders at all levels of the organization talking about the mission. It gives them energy, and they are constantly thinking of ways to get it done.</p>

<h3>7. IT’S NOT JUST A JOB</h3>

<p>People go to movies, hang out at one another’s homes, and sometimes even vacation together. This doesn’t mean they don’t have other friends, but they really enjoy the company of the people they work with.</p>

<h3>8. THE TEAM BELIEVES THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE TASK</h3>

<p>There is a sense that, as employees, they really matter. They aren’t just people filling tasks; but the culture, systems, language, and structure communicate value. Even in tough times with salary freezes or benefit changes, the vibe is still, &ldquo;You matter!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>9. PEOPLE ARE SMILING</h3>

<p>Walk the hallways and you will see people smiling, enjoying conversations, and having a good time in the midst of high productivity and intense focus.</p>

<h3>10. FEAR IS MISSING</h3>

<p>People don’t fret if they say the wrong thing in front of the wrong person. There aren’t hushed conversations because of the fear of what will happen if they are overheard. Employees in an organization with a great culture can walk into the boss’s office with a concern and walk out knowing they were heard.</p>

<h3>11. COMMUNICATION IS STRONG</h3>

<p>From the top to the bottom, people communicate. The staff isn’t surprised with information they didn’t hear until it was announced at a Sunday service or came out in a new product brochure. It is communicated well in advance, with leaders even asking the staff to help find solutions.</p>

<h3>12. CHANGE IS WELCOME</h3>

<p>People aren’t afraid of change. It’s not that everyone likes change, but most have been through it so many times and have seen the leaders manage change with care and dignity that they no longer dread it. Identifying the evidences of a great culture is all fine and good.</p>

<p>This list might be discouraging if you aren’t working in an environment with such a healthy culture. To that person I would suggest: You have the power to change the culture, one day at a time! Building a healthy culture starts with a few determined people.</p>

<p>In just one department, in one corner of the building, a new culture can begin to emerge. As others interact with the healthy department, they are attracted to it. At their core, no one wants to live in a culture of negativity. People want to love their job. They might not know how to act in a positive environment, and they might resist as you call them out of a place of mediocrity, but ultimately love and positivity always wins out.</p>

<p>Get with others who have the same desire, and take that first step!</p>

<li>Sleep is a fundamental and non-negotiable human need.</li>
<li>Sleep allows us to see the world with fresh eyes and a reinvigorated spirit.</li>

<li>A bedroom should be an oasis: a beautiful, relaxing escape from the demands of the day.</li>
<li>We will usher our smartphones out of the bedroom when we go to bed.</li>
<li>We will not drive if we are drowsy!</li>
<li>We will choose Ògoing-to-bed clothes,&ldquo; not to be confused with Ògoing-to-the-gym clothes.&rdquo; Pajamas, nightdresses, and even special T-shirts send a sleep-friendly signal to our bodies: time to shut down!</li>

		<p>Git is one of the most popular source control. Github is one platform built over the top of Git and well adapted by lots of companies. Knowing the right workflow will help to increase the team productivity. In this post, I will try to cover some of the best practices from the community and the way we applied them at <a href="https://www.dwarvesf.com">Dwarves Foundation</a>.</p>

<h1>Git branching model</h1>

<blockquote><p>Source: <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a></p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-06-27-git-model.png"></p>

<p>In sort, you will organise your repository into 5 types of branches:</p>

<h3>The main branches</h3>

<ul>
<li>master: the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a <em>production-ready</em> state</li>
<li>develop: the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. Some would call this the &ldquo;integration branch&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>


<h3>feature</h3>

<ul>
<li>May branch off from: develop</li>
<li>Must merge back into: develop</li>
<li>Branch naming convention: anything except master, develop, release-*, or hotfix-*</li>
</ul>


<p>Feature branches (or sometimes called topic branches) are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. When starting development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will be incorporated may well be unknown at that point.</p>

<h3>release</h3>

<ul>
<li>May branch off from: develop</li>
<li>Must merge back into: develop and master</li>
<li>Branch naming convention: release-*</li>
</ul>


<p>Release branches are created from the develop branch. For example, say version 1.1.5 is the current production release and we have a big release coming up. The state of develop is ready for the “next release” and we have decided that this will become version 1.2 (rather than 1.1.6 or 2.0). So we branch off and give the release branch a name reflecting the new version number</p>

<h3>hotfix</h3>

<ul>
<li>May branch off from: master</li>
<li>Must merge back into: develop and master</li>
<li>Branch naming convention: hotfix-*</li>
</ul>


<p>Hotfix branches are very much like release branches in that they are also meant to prepare for a new production release, albeit unplanned. They arise from the necessity to act immediately upon an undesired state of a live production version. When a critical bug in a production version must be resolved immediately, a hotfix branch may be branched off from the corresponding tag on the master branch that marks the production version.</p>

<h2>Gitflow</h2>

<p>Inspired by Vincent Driessen&rsquo;s branching model, git-flow are a set of git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for it. Git-flow is a merge based solution. It doesn&rsquo;t rebase feature branches.</p>

<ul>
<li>Checkout gitflow cheatsheet: <a href="http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/">http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/</a></li>
<li>Apps that support gitflow:

<ul>
<li>Source Tree: <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">https://www.sourcetreeapp.com</a></li>
<li>Git Tower: <a href="https://www.git-tower.com">https://www.git-tower.com</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Note: Maybe after working for a long time with merge based Gitflow, you will find your git log a little bit confusing and look like that:</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-06-27-gitflow-mess.png"></p>

<p>Please take no worries about this, because there is still a part about <code>git rebase</code>. For now, you can continue to read the article <a href="http://endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful">GitFlow considered harmful</a> to know more about the author issue.</p>

<h1>How to write commit message</h1>

<blockquote><p>Source: <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/</a></p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-06-27-git-commit.png"></p>

<p>Have you ever read some repos with commit messages like above?</p>

<p>While many repositories&#8217; logs look like the former, there are exceptions. The <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master">Linux kernel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commits/master">git itself</a> are great examples. Look at <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commits/master">Spring Boot</a>, or any repository managed by <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/commits/master">Tim Pope</a>. The contributors to these repositories know that a well-crafted git commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to fellow developers (and indeed to their future selves). A diff will tell you what changed, but only the commit message can properly tell you why.</p>

<p>Being known that, a project&rsquo;s long-term success rests (among other things) on its maintainability, reviewing others commits and pull requests is also the big reason that you should write great commit messages.</p>

<p>In the post, the author wants to address the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history: how to write an individual commit message. You can checkout the source article or just follow the <strong>seven rules</strong> below and you&rsquo;re on your way to committing like a pro</p>

<ol>
<li>Separate subject from body with a blank line</li>
<li>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</li>
<li>Capitalize the subject line</li>
<li>Do not end the subject line with a period</li>
<li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line</li>
<li>Wrap the body at 72 characters</li>
<li>Use the body to explain what and why vs. how</li>
</ol>


<h1>Pull Request</h1>

<p>Pull request is a feature that makes it easier for developers to collaborate. Pull request is a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature.</p>

<p>Some tricks to make Pull Requests more awesome for your project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open a Pull Request as early as possible</li>
</ul>


<p>Pull Requests are a great way to start a conversation of a feature, so start one as soon as possible- even before you are finished with the code. Your team can comment on the feature as it evolves, instead of providing all their feedback at the very end.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pull Requests work branch to branch</li>
</ul>


<p>No one has a fork of github/github. We make Pull Requests in the same repository by opening Pull Requests for branches.</p>

<ul>
<li>A Pull Request doesn&rsquo;t have to be merged</li>
</ul>


<p>Pull Requests are easy to make and a great way to get feedback and track progress on a branch. But some ideas don&rsquo;t make it. It&rsquo;s okay to close a Pull Request without merging; we do it all the time.</p>

<p>Hint: Based on an article <a href="http://ben.balter.com/2015/12/08/types-of-pull-requests/">Type of Pull Request</a>, there are 6 types of PR. But <a href="http://ben.straub.cc/2015/04/02/wip-pull-request/"><code>WIP pattern</code></a> is the one that is using by lots of teams and companies. It follows the mantra of &ldquo;<strong>Open a Pull Request as early as possible</strong>&rdquo;.</p>

<h1>Code Review</h1>

<blockquote><p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review">https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review</a></p></blockquote>

<h3>Everyone</h3>

<ul>
<li>Accept that many programming decisions are opinions. Discuss tradeoffs, which you prefer, and reach a resolution quickly.</li>
<li>Ask questions; don&rsquo;t make demands. (&ldquo;What do you think about naming this :user_id?&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Ask for clarification. (&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand. Can you clarify?&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Avoid selective ownership of code. (&ldquo;mine&rdquo;, &ldquo;not mine&rdquo;, &ldquo;yours&rdquo;)</li>

<h1>Rebase vs Merge</h1>

<blockquote><p>Source: <a href="https://blog.sourcetreeapp.com/2012/08/21/merge-or-rebase/">https://blog.sourcetreeapp.com/2012/08/21/merge-or-rebase/</a></p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-06-27-merge-rebase.png"></p>

<ul>
<li>Merging brings two lines of development together while preserving the ancestry of each commit history.</li>
<li>In contrast, rebasing unifies the lines of development by re-writing changes from the source branch so that they appear as children of the destination branch – effectively pretending that those commits were written on top of the destination branch all along.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Merging Pros</h4>

<ul>
<li>Simple to use and understand.</li>
<li>Maintains the original context of the source branch.</li>
<li>The commits on the source branch remain separate from other branch commits, provided you don’t perform a fast-forward merge. This separation can be useful in the case of feature branches, where you might want to take a feature and merge it into another branch later.</li>
<li>Existing commits on the source branch are unchanged and remain valid; it doesn’t matter if they’ve been shared with others.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Merging Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>If the need to merge arises simply because multiple people are working on the same branch in parallel, the merges don’t serve any useful historic purpose and create clutter.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Rebase Pros</h4>

<ul>
<li>Simplifies your history.</li>
<li>Is the most intuitive and clutter-free way to combine commits from multiple developers in a shared branch</li>
</ul>


<h4>Rebase Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>Slightly more complex, especially under conflict conditions. Each commit is rebased in order, and a conflict will interrupt the process of rebasing multiple commits. With a conflict, you have to resolve the conflict in order to continue the rebase. SourceTree guides you through this process, but it can still become a bit more complicated.</li>
<li>Rewriting of history has ramifications if you’ve previously pushed those commits elsewhere. In Mercurial, you simply cannot push commits that you later intend to rebase, because anyone pulling from the remote will get them. In Git, you may push commits you may want to rebase later (as a backup) but only if it’s to a remote branch that only you use. If anyone else checks out that branch and you later rebase it, it’s going to get very confusing.</li>
</ul>

		<p>Git is one of the most popular source control. Github is one platform built over the top of Git and well adapted by lots of companies. Knowing the right workflow will help to increase team productivity. In this post, I will try to cover some of the best practices from the community and the way we applied them at <a href="https://www.dwarves.foundation">Dwarves Foundation</a>.</p>

<h1>Know how to write good commit message</h1>

<blockquote><p>Source: <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/</a></p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-06-27-git-commit.png"></p>

<p>Have you ever read some repos with commit messages like above?</p>

<p>While many repositories&#8217; logs look like the former, there are exceptions. The <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master">Linux kernel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commits/master">git itself</a> are great examples. Look at <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commits/master">Spring Boot</a>, or any repository managed by <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/commits/master">Tim Pope</a>. The contributors to these repositories know that a well-crafted git commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to fellow developers (and indeed to their future selves). A diff will tell you what changed, but only the commit message can properly tell you why.</p>

<p>Being known that, a project&rsquo;s long-term success rests (among other things) on its maintainability, reviewing others commits and pull requests is also the big reason that you should write great commit messages.</p>

<p>In the post, the author wants to address the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history: how to write an individual commit message. You can checkout the source article or just follow the <strong>seven rules</strong> below and you&rsquo;re on your way to committing like a pro</p>

<ol>
<li>Separate subject from body with a blank line</li>
<li>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</li>
<li>Capitalize the subject line</li>
<li>Do not end the subject line with a period</li>
<li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line</li>
<li>Wrap the body at 72 characters</li>
<li>Use the body to explain what and why vs. how</li>
</ol>


<h1>Git branching model</h1>

<h1>Gitflow</h1>

<p>Inspired by Vincent Driessen&rsquo;s branching model, git-flow are a set of git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for it. Git-flow is a merge based solution. It doesn&rsquo;t rebase feature branches.</p>

<ul>
<li>Checkout gitflow cheatsheet: <a href="http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/">http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/</a></li>
<li>Apps that support gitflow:

<ul>
<li>Source Tree: <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">https://www.sourcetreeapp.com</a></li>
<li>Git Tower: <a href="https://www.git-tower.com">https://www.git-tower.com</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Note: Maybe after working for a long time with merge based Gitflow, you will find your git log a little bit confusing and look like that:</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-06-27-gitflow-mess.png"></p>

<p>Please take no worries about this, because there is still a part about <code>git rebase</code>. For now, you can continue to read the article <a href="http://endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful">GitFlow considered harmful</a> to know more about the author issue.</p>

<h3>Gitflow pitfall</h3>

<ul>
<li>It makes the project&rsquo;s history completely unreadable with the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9069061/what-is-the-difference-between-git-merge-and-git-merge-no-ff"><code>--no-ff</code> flag</a>. The &mdash;no-ff flag prevents git merge from executing a &ldquo;fast-forward&rdquo; if it detects that your current HEAD is an ancestor of the commit you&rsquo;re trying to merge. A fast-forward is when, instead of constructing a merge commit, git just moves your branch pointer to point at the incoming commit.</li>
<li>The master/develop split is redundant.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s needlessly complex. And people make mistakes and break them by accident.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Anti-gitflow</h3>

<ul>
<li>There is only one eternal branch &ndash; you can call it master, develop, current, next &ndash; whatever. I personally like &ldquo;master&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s the name I&rsquo;ll use in the rest of the description, as it&rsquo;s convention by now in the Git world and immediately conveys its purpose.</li>
<li>All other branches (feature, release, hotfix, and whatever else you need) are temporary and only used as a convenience to share code with other developers and as a backup measure. They are always removed once the changes present on them land on master.</li>
<li>Features are integrated onto the master branch primarily in a way which keeps the history linear. You have a lot of leeway in how you want to enforce this. You can make it simply a convention that developers are encouraged, but not forced, to follow. On the other side of the spectrum, if you use something like Gerrit to manage your Git repositories (which I recommend, even if you don&rsquo;t practice code reviews &ndash; the permission system is fantastic, and if you ever decide you want code reviews, it&rsquo;ll be very easy to start doing them), you can set up permissions in such a way that actually forbids pushing merge commits to master, and that way ensure linear history.</li>
<li>Releases are done similarly to in GitFlow. You create a new branch for the release, branching off at the point in master that you decide has all the necessary features. From then on new work, aimed for the next release, is pushed to master as always, and any necessary changes are pushed to the release branch (in my opinion, it&rsquo;s an anti-pattern and a huge red flag if your release requires separate commits to work, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another article &ndash; for simplicity, let&rsquo;s assume you can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t want to change that). Finally, once the release is ready, you tag the top of the release branch. Then, because there is one eternal branch, there is only one way to get your release to be versioned permanently &ndash; and that is to merge the release branch into master and push that changed master. After that, all the changes that were made during the release are now part of master, and the release branch is deleted.</li>
<li>Hotfixes are very similar to releases, except you don&rsquo;t branch from an arbitrary commit on master, but from the release tag that you want to make the fix in. Again, work on master continues as always, and the necessary fixes are pushed to the hotfix branch. Once the fix is ready, the procedure is exactly the same as for a release &ndash; tag the top of the branch creating a new release, merge it into master, then delete the hotfix branch.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Pull Request</h1>

<p>Pull request is a feature that makes it easier for developers to collaborate. Pull request is a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. Some tricks to make Pull Requests more awesome for your project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open a Pull Request as early as possible: Pull Requests are a great way to start a conversation of a feature, so start one as soon as possible- even before you are finished with the code. Your team can comment on the feature as it evolves, instead of providing all their feedback at the very end.</li>
<li>Pull Requests work branch to branch: No one has a fork of github/github. We make Pull Requests in the same repository by opening Pull Requests for branches.</li>
<li>A Pull Request doesn&rsquo;t have to be merged: Pull Requests are easy to make and a great way to get feedback and track progress on a branch. But some ideas don&rsquo;t make it. It&rsquo;s okay to close a Pull Request without merging; we do it all the time.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hint: Based on an article <a href="http://ben.balter.com/2015/12/08/types-of-pull-requests/">Type of Pull Request</a>, there are 6 types of PR. But <a href="http://ben.straub.cc/2015/04/02/wip-pull-request/"><code>WIP pattern</code></a> is the one that is using by lots of teams and companies. It follows the mantra of &ldquo;<strong>Open a Pull Request as early as possible</strong>&rdquo;.</p>

<h1>Doing Code Review</h1>

<li>Ask for clarification. (&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand. Can you clarify?&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Avoid selective ownership of code. (&ldquo;mine&rdquo;, &ldquo;not mine&rdquo;, &ldquo;yours&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Avoid using terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits. (&ldquo;dumb&rdquo;, &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;). Assume everyone is attractive, &ndash; intelligent, and well-meaning.</li>

		<h2>Homebrew</h2>

<p>Homebrew (or brew) is one of the biggest repo on Github with more than 29k stars, 14k forks and 1k watches. It was started by Max Howell in 2009 to build the missing package manager for OS X. Back to before 2009, in Mac OSX, if we wanted to install something, we had to install it via pkg files or bin files. We didn&rsquo;t have anything fancy like <code>apt-get</code> in Ubuntu or <code>yum</code> in Fedora. MacPort was an only option but it was not too good. Check the very old article about it: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/25/homebrew-the-perfect-gift-for-command-line-lovers/">Homebrew, the perfect gift for command line lovers</a></p>

<p>For now, you can access homebrew via</p>

<ul>
<li>Homepage: <a href="http://brew.sh">http://brew.sh</a></li>
<li>Github: <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew">https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew</a></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-03-13-homebrew.png"></p>

<p>To install homebrew, you just need to run the ruby script and you will get <code>brew</code> command ready in couple of minutes.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Homebrew is developed in Ruby and its program will be defined as a formula which is simple Ruby script. Most of tools can be found in Homebrew such as: docker, ruby, python, ansible, todo.txt, &hellip; At this time they have over 3k5 formulas that was contributed by community.</p>

<p>Simple use cases for Homebrew after you got it:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>// $FORMULA is the name of your formula
</span><span class='line'>$ brew install $FORMULA</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Brew makes it really easy to update and upgrade. Because everything is based on Git, you just need to run those below commands then everything will be done automatically.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ brew update
</span><span class='line'>$ brew upgrade</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>How to contribute to Homebrew</h2>

<p>Note: In this post, we just cover the command line or tool part of Homebrew. The example is taken from our <a href="https://github.com/dwarvesf/glod-cli"><strong>glod-cli</strong></a></p>

<p>When you look into the repo of Homebrew, you can easily find the doc directory in <code>homebrew/share/doc/homebrew/</code> which contains all the information. The most important file for this tutorial is the <code>Formula-Cookbook.md</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-03-13-homebrew-doc.png"></p>

<p>Basically, when you use homebrew, it will create a separate folder on your machine. Everything usually will be installed in <code>/usr/local/Cellar</code> and all formulas was stored at <code>/usr/local/Library/Formula</code>.</p>

<p>So in short, if you want to contribute a new one, you need to create a new formula in your local and submit a pull request to <code>https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew</code>.</p>

<h3>Fork from homebrew</h3>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-03-13-homebrew.png"></p>

<p>For us, we will have a repo called <code>dwarvesf/homebrew</code> which we can clone and start from there.</p>

<h3>Create new formula</h3>

<p>Make sure you have installed <code>brew</code> on your machine (you have to!) and your new formula must meets all their <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Acceptable-Formulae.md">Acceptable Formulae</a> requirements.</p>

<p>Then we can start from create a new branch (like git workflow) or not. For us we skip it and use the master branch (plot twist: we forgot to do this step)</p>

<p>We move to the step of create new formula by run the command</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ brew create &lt;URL.tar.gz&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Example for us, we use the archive url of our github repo <code>https://github.com/dwarvesf/glod-cli/archive/1.0.3.2.tar.gz</code>. You can get it by combining</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>https://github.com/&lt;YOUR REPO&gt;/archive/&lt;COMMIT SHA | TAG&gt;.tar.gz</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This command will help to create a local formula in <code>/usr/local/Library/Formula</code> and open with your default $EDITOR. You have to write a small Ruby script to <code>install</code> and <code>test</code> the formula. You can refer to other formulas to make it easier. Check out the main repo <code>https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula</code> or the forked one. If you have Go formula like us, you can easily search for more than 100 existed Go formulas. It&rsquo;s a great source for references.</p>

<p>Our formula looks like this</p>

<h3>Install / Debug local formula</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">brew</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">verbose</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">debug</span> <span class="vg">$FORMULA</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This command will help to install your formula at <code>/usr/local/Library/Formula</code>. Happy debugging until you can install it smoothly.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will need to uninstall the formula, you can use this command</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">brew</span> <span class="n">unlink</span> <span class="vg">$FORMULA</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">brew</span> <span class="n">cleanup</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Test the formula</h3>

<p>One note for the test block, there are still a lot of formula that try to cheat by printing out the help or version. As a good contributor, you should write good tests for your formulas or your pull request will be rejected (like us)</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-03-13-homebrew-failed-test.png"></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">brew</span> <span class="nb">test</span> <span class="vg">$FORMULA</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">brew</span> <span class="n">audit</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">strict</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">online</span> <span class="vg">$FORMULA</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Those tests should be passed to make sure your formula is qualified. The second command is provided to check if your formula have</p>

<ul>
<li>More than 50 stars</li>
<li>More than 20 forks</li>
<li>More than 20 watchers</li>
<li>And initialized more than 30 days</li>
</ul>


<h3>Submit pull request</h3>

<p>Bravo! It&rsquo;s really great if you can get here, your formula is qualified. Let&rsquo;s copy the local formula to your git repo. Example</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cp</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="sr">/usr/</span><span class="n">local</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="no">Library</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="no">Formula</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">glod</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">cli</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rb</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="sr">/Workspace/</span><span class="n">dwarvesf</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">homebrew</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="no">Library</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="no">Formula</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Commit and push your changes to <strong>YOUR</strong> Github. Then we open the Github Repo (still yours), click on button <code>New pull request</code> and we get</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-03-13-homebrew-pull-request.png"></p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2016-03-13-homebrew-pull-request-02.png"></p>

<p>We did it! You only still need the feedback from Homebrew team. You can leave your keyboard and take a cup of coffee. If everything goes well, well done boss! you have just contribute to one of the famous repo in the internet. Congratulations!</p>
