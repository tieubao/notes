		<p>I&rsquo;m the founder of Dwarves Foundation, a software development firm that based in South East Asia. We use both languages in production and have developed some web apps, systems using Go and Elixir.</p>

<p>First of all, I have to say both languages are great, same as the communities. They are both concurrency languages, but there are some differences in their souls.</p>

<p>If you come from the background of Python, Go take the same approach of &lsquo;manual language.&rsquo; Go is a minimal language. Go replaces the inheritance by the composition (which said by someone &ldquo;Inheritance was a bad dream that (most) people have woken up from.&rdquo;) There is no magic in Go source code. Also, with the support of &lsquo;gofmt&rsquo; (syntax formatter), it brings you the transparency of knowledge between your source code and others. You will feel no hesitation to read the source code of your friends or open source libraries in Github.</p>

<p><strong>Go is the best fit for API services and command line tool development</strong>. Go is a &lsquo;have-to-learn&rsquo; language for engineers.</p>

<p>Go brings you the feel of &lsquo;it just works&rsquo; language after years working with it in several projects. Talking a little bit more about Go web frameworks, they do have a good framework for web development: Gin, echo, goji &hellip; are the minimal one like Flask, Express or Sinatra; Beego, Revel are full-fledged or battery included frameworks like Django, Sails or Rails. However, at the end of the day, you don&rsquo;t want to use those frameworks or ORMs at all, you will just want to use built-in components of Go to build your new system. That&rsquo;s the moment when you have been enlightened to feel the minimalism of Go. &ldquo;It just works,&rdquo; the gopher in you will speak to yourself.</p>

<p>You can take reference to <a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server">mattermost</a> repository to learn more the stack of Go as API server and React for web front-end.</p>

<hr />

<p>After the long time working with Go and if you are the type of lazy developers, you will find that Go language itself isn&rsquo;t wise enough. Go makes sense outside of the web dev world. As a web developer, you still need the super fast speed, but you want something as cool as Rails, Elixir/Phoenix is good for you.</p>

<ul>
<li>Functional Programming vs. OOP (<a href="https://medium.com/@brianwill/object-oriented-programming-a-personal-disaster-1b044c2383ab">Object-Oriented Programming: A Disaster Story</a>)</li>
<li>Fault tolerance. It&rsquo;s something Go doesn&rsquo;t have. If an Erlang process (not an OS process, an Erlang process) dies, it dies. Every other process on the system is fine and Erlang has facilities to have processes monitor other processes and bring each other back up if one dies. It&rsquo;s just amazing. Absolutely beautiful.</li>
<li>Abstract Syntax Trees. The one that brings <strong>Homoiconicity</strong> which is believed to be the source of power of Lisp.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>We are soldiers. We use different guns or knives in different purposes.
At the moment, our stack is as below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Go for API server, cmd line tools, and DevOps scripts.</li>
<li>Elixir for web development.</li>
<li>Vue.js for frontend development</li>
</ul>

		<p>Continuous learning is one of my passion and I kept doing this for about 4 years. Everyday life, the knowledge bypass my brain and go thru. People write a lot of awesome stuffs on Medium, their personal blogs or HackerNews. I used to note them to Notes or Evernote before. Later I found those tools are very frustrating, hard to look up and I even did not open them again.</p>

<p>As a former CTO &amp; Tech Entrepreneur, Github is one of the most opened site of mine. With filtering and labeling features, we can easily organize our references to the articles. The labels will help you to classify the information and it&rsquo;s cool to make the search after that, easier to share with your friends, your colleagues.</p>

<p>So, I decided to note them all on Github.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-12-03-til.png"></p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p><em>&ldquo;Today I learned&rdquo;</em> is not the new idea, people around the world used different ways to implement the idea. If you have time, let google around and you can find some interesting topic on reddit or medium about this methodology. People call it by various name Today I/We learned, Today I found out &hellip; but the same concept is that you should keep yourself up and run. It&rsquo;s all about the productivity, the improvement of yourself. Improving yourself just 1% everyday and in a year you are better than 37.8 times.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-12-03-101.jpg"></p>

<p>If you are interested in this idea, you can follow the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/til">#til</a> on Twitter or making one and share your <strong>#til</strong> repo.</p>

		<h1>The developer</h1>

<p>In linux, the files start with a dot &ldquo;.&rdquo; are hidden. If you list files in the directory, they normally don&rsquo;t show up and keep them safe from the users. Because of that reason, the developer usually use it to store configurations of their tools. Those files are so called dotfiles. The first dot file for most of us is maybe the shell configuration file (.bashrc | .bash_profile)</p>

<blockquote><p>Nowsday, you can find the dotfiles everywhere in your system.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do you use git? vim?
Do you use your ssh identities to authenticate with git server?
Do you have any env configurations or even the backup from other apps?</p>

<p>We are software developer. Our machine is more like our second home. We spend more than 8 hours per day with it. I have a friend from Singapore. Last time when I was with him drunk, I asked him for who is his gf and suddenly he pointed at his laptop. What a nerd!</p>

<p>Back to the point, as a developer, we use a lot of tools and applications that need to back up.</p>

<h1>The community</h1>

<p>Years ago, people don&rsquo;t think about back up the dotfiles. Because we spend a lot of time with the shell, so most of the time, people just value their config for the shell. There are some topics around for people to show off their shell config. But this turned out a good start of the community.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=679762">Show us your .bashrc!</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=41331">Share your bashrc!</a></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9he4v/share_your_bashrc_vimrc_or_other_settings_file_i">Share your .bashrc, .vimrc, or other settings file</a></p>

<p>  <img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-11-05-allias.png"></p></li>
</ul>


<p>After a few years, technology changed really fast and bring developers lots of useful tools like homebrew, z, logcat-color, &hellip; Developers use different tech stacks and they have their own setting for the workspace. Once they change the workspace or move from machine to machine, it takes so many hours to setup again. That&rsquo;s why some guys start to think about all their dotfiles and back up their workspace config.</p>

<p>If you are new for dotfiles, you can have a quick look at: <a href="https://dotfiles.github.io.">https://dotfiles.github.io.</a> They organise most popular dotfiles for you to look at or start with. You can browse some repo to learn from the community, discover new tools for your toolbox and new tricks for the ones you already use.</p>

<h1>Mine</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m a geek and a tech entreprenuer. I&rsquo;m also the founder of Dwarves Foundation. We offer venture builder service and a strong tech team to help people build their tech company.</p>

<p>I began to care about my dotfiles for a year. You can find it around Github @ <a href="https://github.com/tieubao/dotfiles">tieubao/dotfiles</a></p>

<p>And you can find my dotfiles helpful if you are using the same stack as me:</p>

<ul>
<li>OSX user</li>
<li>Install stuffs via homebrew</li>
<li>Editor: vim (or sublime)</li>
<li>Develop backend in Golang</li>
<li>Frontend with React</li>
<li>Terminal addicted with zsh and prezto framework</li>
<li>Not another git newbie</li>
<li><p>Docker centric workflow</p>

		<h1>Teamwork</h1>

<p>It all happened because of the important of the true teamwork in every project. Teamwork is one of many factors to the success of the team. I also wrote a <a href="http://tieubao.me/writing/2014/12/05/it-is-hard-to-become-a-team-member/">post</a> about it last year. At Dwarves Foundation, teamwork is all about Synchronization and Collaboration, which mean, as a members, you need to know about and align your goal to the team goal; you have to know what other people are doing and let people know what you&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s also about the way of communication between members, it&rsquo;s not just hard skill, it&rsquo;s better if you can stay and play well with others. We applied Slack and Trello to keep us posted, but it seems it&rsquo;s not enough. The information about other members work need to be more details but should not some kind of micro management. There is a difference between the proactive and micro management, the awareness about the micro management will kill team productivity.</p>

<h1>Digest Systems</h1>

<p>And I think about how could I make the team better? Last time at Lifebox, we created Lifebox Daily, a productivity tool based on <a href="">Done list theory</a> which is very similar with <a href="https://idonethis.com">iDoneThis</a>. Later we found that Google Group digest system is free and good enough to replace the old Lifebox Daily. Everyday, team memmbers just need to send an email with the same title (like current date) to Google Group Email and on next day morning, Google Group will send a digest message including all done items of other members. So that the team can aware of what happened yesterday and keep them motivated.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-08-30-google-digest-01.png"></p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-08-30-google-digest-02.png"></p>

<p>After 2 months experiment, some members said that they felt the others are a little inactive and team culture cannot build from there. That is really a big issue that we need to solve it as soon as possible. If the team don&rsquo;t share the same things, they can easily be broken up. So we decided to apply daily scrum in the morning and digest at the end of the day but things turned out there was lots of process and we spent more time on meeting.</p>

<h1>Working On</h1>

<p>To keep thing simple but work, we built <a href="https://github.com/dwarvesf/working-on">working-on</a>, a combination of donelist theory and scrum daily concept, integrated with Slack slash command, support public channel and project group for multiple teams. We had successfully applied it to our team and we want to share it to you. Too simple to setup via Heroku.</p>

<h3>How to use</h3>

<p>When you start to do something, go to Slack and use slash command <code>/working-on &lt;what are you going to do&gt;</code> to let your teammates know about it. The geek can use cli. And it just take you 5 seconds.</p>

<p>On the next day morning, the bot will make the digest and post it to the digest channel, so that everyone else can have a full view, even the manager or leader. It&rsquo;s also make others motivated by seeing what you&rsquo;ve achieved.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-08-30-working-on.png"></p>

<p>And the team feel happy with Working On bot. They started using it daily.</p>

<p>Working On is built on <strong>Golang</strong>, <strong>Gin</strong> framework with support from <strong>Heroku</strong> One click deploy button. You can deploy one for your team at <a href="https://github.com/dwarvesf/working-on"><em>Github</em></a>.</p>

		<p>And tonight, he decides to write it down, to keep him still remember about what happened today and 3 years ago. This time, he uses Eng instead of his mother language to keep things as simple as they can. He wants to hide his emotion.</p>

<p>4 years ago, he fell in love with his high school classmate. They were so called the not incommensurate couple and he thought that he had found his lifetime partner. He put his soul into that relationship. Everything was fine till she decided to go on a date with new guy. He was betrayed, he thought.</p>

<p>His heart was broken down into pieces and in the deep down inside, he told himself that do not believe in it anymore. From the other side, it&rsquo;s usual in Vietnam that girls often listen to their oldman to marry another guy. Within a small chance, he tried his best to pull her back. He succeeded but his heart still empty as hell.</p>

<p>Talking more about him, he is special over his friends and he is more extrovert, not exactly, with the best of both side, he is really good at thinking about stuffs over there. He is proud of his awareness skill. Sometime, he is better to become an introvert.</p>

<p>He keeps everything inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s break up. It&rsquo;s over.&rdquo; &ndash; She said.
It happens usually that people can think that is monthly event.</p>

<p>He starts to think of the whole story from the very beginning. Every single piece of memory make his heart broken, again and again. He wonders if she knows how much he loves her.</p>

<p>He starts to dig out all of the memories, every notes that he wrote for her, every moments that they spent time together. He traverses thru the past to reflect the relationship but what he found is all the love that he has. Every single place is full of her. He cannot take it anymore.</p>

<p>He still loves her.</p>

<p>But this time, he decides to move forward.</p>

		<h3></h3>

<p>We are members of Dwarves Foundation. We are small group of engineers and talented people. At this time we are tech partners with PearComms and Sales In One, 2 companies from Singapore. We work at the office in District 3 that we hire from a friend of the founder, it make us free to access 24/7. The office is just about 30 square meters and available for 8 to 10 9owl at the same time.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-05-30-team.jpg"></p>

<p>We love to work at night, not daytime. We have coffee and tea, people to talk with, place to work and corner to take a nap. We love to discuss about engineering, technology and life hacking stuffs. We are outliers, we are special and we know it. We want to make friend with people that like us.</p>

<h3>9owl &ndash; Working space that only available at night</h3>

<p>Me, have an idea that cool people should know each other, have a place to come and work at night, to be friends or not. But I believe, people that live the same lifestyle, have same mindset should be easy to make friend and more. So I start 9owl and give the office for free.</p>

<p><a href="http://dwarvesf.com/9owl/"><strong>9owl</strong></a> is <strong>invite only</strong> group and it costs you nothing. Join us for the midnight coffee, good talks, warm bed and cool work place.</p>

<p>Updated: We moved to new office on 2017 Sept and it&rsquo;s too dam cool. I&rsquo;m very happy to have you guys here.</p>

		<p>After an interesting journey at <a href="/notes/a/cau-chuyen-khoi-nghiep-tu-lifebox-den-cloudjay-p1/">CloudJay</a>, I took a short break for a month and feel that startup life is too hard for young people but it&rsquo;s really worth to be a part startup scene. Someone said, one year to live in a startup is better than five years working in the enterprise. And I think this is correct. I need to face more problems and be able to solve them myself to be more mature.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-entrepreneur.jpg"></p>

<p>I also find that Google Golang is interesting and it might be useful for us later. I bet my investment on it and found <a href="https://golang.org.vn">Golang Vietnam</a>, a network of Golang Developers in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Based on some connections with friends in Singapore, I start asking people about other software businesses. And begin to find my first early member. I named a team <a href="https://dwarves.foundation">Dwarves Foundation</a>. Dwarf is the small and misshapen creatures in Norse Mythology that are wisdom, natural good at smithing, mining, and crafting. My plan is to provide Tech Partner service to ventures and startups.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-dwarves.jpg"></p>

<h2>Our values</h2>

<p>We are a team of geeks, hustles and startup veterans. We live around the world but most of us based in Saigon, Vietnam. We are (forever) young and always eager to learn. We have passion and experience in making cool products, esp. cloud and mobile apps. We want to help entrepreneurs solve real problems using our approachs and solutions.</p>

<h2>Workflow at Dwarves Foundation</h2>

<h3>For project management</h3>

<p>We use Trello with Kanban theory to organize tasks. Tasks will be flew from left list to right list. We also organize lists into Scrum steps. So this will be liked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sprint Planning</li>
<li>Current Sprint</li>
<li>In Progress</li>
<li>Blocked</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Bugs Report</li>
<li>Approved</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-trello.png"></p>

<p>For each project, we will have <em>Sprint planning meeting</em> for Project Manager to explain project details to project members. User stories will be converted into cards or tickets and added to Trello list > <strong>Sprint Planning</strong>.</p>

<p>Usually, one sprint is about 1 or 2 weeks, we have weekly meeting to break user stories into tasks and add them to list Current Sprint. It&rsquo;s also our target for this week, we have to get in done. This time, cards need to have requirement and non requirement specification. And sometimes, if this task has some special requirement that developers need to care about, the Project Manager need to add <strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-criteria.png"></p>

<p>As a customer, you are granted permission to access Trello Board to give feedback or be a tester. And most of my customers are happy with it.</p>

<p>The template for this workflow can be found at <a href="https://trello.com/b/WYgcFBgl/sprint-template">https://trello.com/b/WYgcFBgl/sprint-template</a></p>

<h3>For source code management</h3>

<p>We use <code>git</code> and GitLab. It&rsquo;s more like GitHub but for enterprise. You can have one by downloading and deploying it yourself.</p>

<p>We apply <a href="http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/">Gitflow</a> and <code>Merge Request</code> (some people may call it Pull Request) between developers to gain some benefits from it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can deliver anytime because branch <code>master</code> is always stable.</li>
<li>Quality source code: always review it after it&rsquo;s merged into branch <code>develep</code></li>
<li>High efficiency collaboration between team members.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-gitflow.png"></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another article about it on Atlassian site: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow</a></p>

<p>Project Manager will be the one that init the repository on Git with some imporatant informations. For every ticket on Trello, developers need to create one issue in GitLab, create new feature branch and start the implementation on it. The <code>git commit</code> command must attach with one or more than one issue.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-commit.png"></p>

<p>After that, one merge request will be created and the person who has responsibility to review this request need to check over the source code then <code>Accept</code> or <code>Reject</code> the <code>Merge Request</code>.</p>

<p>This card will be moved to list <code>Testing</code>, QC will be assigned to test this feature and so on.</p>

<h3>For Communication</h3>

<p>We use <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> as the main hub for all informations, from team meeting, hangout, manage tasks and source code &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-slack.png"></p>

<p>Slack support lots of methods to add integration. So the powerful it can be depends on what you integrate into it.</p>

<p>Finally, at the end of the day, we do daily meeting via hangout or face to face at the office to summary what we have done today and what we plan to do tomorrow. The project manager will be the one to write it down and make weekly report to customer.</p>

<p>All the processes out there are just to make the team stick together and development plan works. All team members need to understand their roles, team vision and know how to make things go on the right tracks.</p>

		<h1>Overview</h1>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-04-02-golang-in-a-nutshell.png"></p>

<p>Go is a better C++. In 2015, its mission is to be a cloud language and to replace C in some points. Many companies had ported a few parts of their system to Go. Go currently competes with Java in performance; with amazing syntax and features. Go is used to design system or web service. Somebody try to compare it to Rust, but they are not the same. Rust is lower level than Go and so called the better C.</p>

<p>For beginner:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read some background about Go to get motivation.</li>
<li>Pick your editor</li>
<li><p>Learn syntax through the Playground, which can be found on Golang.org</p>

<ul>
<li>Go by example: <a href="https://gobyexample.com/">https://gobyexample.com/</a></li>
<li>Tour of Go: <a href="https://tour.golang.org/">https://tour.golang.org/</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try one full-fledged MVC Web Framework to write a web app</p></li>

				Tying Lessons Learned to Project Failure</a>

		<p>If one of the main benefits of lessons learned discussions is to prevent future project failure, then why not structure your lessons learned around the top 5 causes of project failure? You’d be capturing targeted lessons that could be fed into the Project Management Office and project teams to provide tangible routes for improvement.</p>

<p>According to a survey by PM Solutions, the top 5 causes of troubled projects are:
Requirements Resources Schedules Planning Risk. Let’s look more closely at some of the lesson that might result from these areas.</p>

<h1>1. Requirements</h1>

<p>Unclear or ambiguous requirements Lessons for future projects: finalise requirements in advance or adopt Agile practices that make it possible to manage unclear requirements.</p>

<p>Lack of agreement; contradictory requirements Lessons for future projects: make sure that one person has authority to resolve requirements disputes. Ensure change management processes are in place with someone prioritising changes. Note that personalities and departmental culture combined with a silo mentality might make this problem worse.</p>

<p>Lack of priority Lessons for future projects: ensure project priority overall is known, especially in relation to other projects. While you might not be working on the highest priority projects in the company, you should know where you fit and how that might play out when it comes to negotiating for resources. Prioritise individual requirements on the project in case resource conflicts mean not everything can be achieved and some requirements have to wait for a future phase.</p>

<h1>2. Resources</h1>

<p>Lack of resources; losing key resources Lessons for future projects: Prepare adequate estimates for the resources required. Schedule people at 80% (or less) not 100% of their time on your project. Manage staff turnover on the project team by planning properly for upcoming vacations and longer absences like maternity leave. Work closely with line managers to watch out for project resources who are likely to leave the company and ensure you have training plans to upskill others if necessary.</p>

<p>Resource conflicts Lessons for future projects: Plan adequately. Work with other project managers to identify where part-time resources may be required on your project and theirs to ensure that you create an overall resource plan at portfolio level (even if in practice that’s just sharing the resource between the two projects).</p>

<p>Poor planning Lessons for future projects: Project team members need adequate notice of tasks and the information and resources required to get the work done. Ensure all of this is provided, along with adequate support and training to provide the skills required to complete the tasks. Involve the team in preparing estimates.</p>

<h1>3. Schedules</h1>

<p>Unrealistic scheduling Lessons for future projects: There could be lots of lessons here! Plan in contingency time based on the risk profile of your project. Use good change management processes to ensure that any changes are adequately scoped and incorporated including any time changes required. Involve project team members in preparing the estimates and confirming that the plan looks realistic</p>

<p>Overly optimistic scheduling Lessons for future projects: Avoid what Roland Hoffman calls confirmation bias (the risk that you go for estimates that you believe are true even though the evidence points to the contrary) and other decision-making problems by running your schedule past another project manager. Make the most of peer reviews and quality audits offered by your Project Management Office.</p>

<h1>4. Planning</h1>

<p>Insufficient details or processes Lessons for future projects: Adopt good project management practices and a standard methodology. Work closely with your sponsor or customer representative to get a good understanding of their vision and objectives. If possible, second someone to the project team to provide this business view on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>Poor estimating Lessons for future projects: Consider other estimating techniques such as three-point estimating. Look at the estimates from other similar projects. Use expert input. Add adequate contingency based on what’s known about the task. Estimate for the resource who is completing the task, not the most efficient and speedy person you know.</p>

<h1>5. Risk</h1>

<p>Unidentified project risk Lessons for future projects: Uncover as many project risks as possible. Regularly review the risk log. Give everyone on the team the opportunity to raise new risks. Consider positive risk as well as negative risk. Use standard risk identification practices and workshops to identify as many risks as possible.</p>

<p>Inadequate or inaccurate assumptions Lessons for future projects: Review the project assumptions with subject matter experts. Keep an assumptions log and review it regularly; update the assumptions when more details are known as this should be a working document.</p>

<p>Unmanaged project risk Lessons for future projects: Use standard risk management processes and apply mitigation techniques. Keep an action log for each risk. Review risks regularly at team meetings and ensure they are being worked on. Make use of peer reviews and informal audits to hold yourself accountable for risk management. Ensure each risk has an owner.</p>

<p>While lessons learned have a lot to offer when it comes to avoiding the causes of project failure, the downside of this approach is that you have to have a project fail, or not deliver as planned, in order to reap the lessons. One project manager’s disaster is another’s lucky break. If you are the unlucky project manager dealing with a failed project, then take solace from the fact that you are making it easier for your fellow project managers (and yourself) to deal with problem projects in the future.</p>
