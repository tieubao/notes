<p>It had been an year since Barcamp 2013 at RMIT. &ldquo;<a href="http://www.barcampsaigon.org/">BarcampSaigon</a> is an unconference that was created in the tech community in 2005. Organizers of the event only organized the space and the people from the community were the presenters. That means the quality of the event depends on the community. Today, Barcamps are held in over 350 cities across the world. BarcampSaigon was started in 2008 and there have been 6 in Saigon so far. So come to BarcampSaigon and present about anything you want! The community will vote on topics and the top topics will get the biggest rooms.&rdquo; They said.</p>

<p>This year I come to Barcamp Saigon with a topic about Android App Development: <code>How to handle large dataset in Android with SnappyDB</code></p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2014-12-14-me-at-barcamp.JPG"></p>

<p>My company, <a href="https://www.cloudjay.com/">CloudJay</a>, is providing a realtime computing service named <a href="http://tieubao.me/writing/project/cjay/">CJayNet</a>. It targets on optimizing the process of dry and reefer container repairs and maintainance services of Vietnam depots and also cutting down the gap time between office users and field workers by using the combination of Cloud Computing, Smartphones and Realtime features.</p>

<p>At the beginning of product development, we used SQLite and Content Provider in Data Layer. Time flies and those data scale up to more than thousand of records and it causes application performance go down. After a period of time struggling around finding solution, we find SnappyDB the Saviour after trying Realm.</p>

<p>There are over 20 campers join my session. It is a really hard topic for people (even for the senior developers) and I do not expect that much attendees (wow). It&rsquo;s a good experience to be a speaker at Barcamp.</p>

<p>This year, I have met a lot of friends and amazing people. This is my first time listening to someone topic that so much exciting. Many thanks to anh Ho Viet Hai about the topic <code>Delivering great experience</code>. Things that he told us:</p>

<ul>
<li>You really need to care about the experience and also put your experience, your soul into your product</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/needs/robbins_needs.htm">Robbins' Human Needs</a></li>
<li>Telling your story</li>
</ul>


<p>Other topics are good too but I cannot join all of them.</p>

<p>Finally, another barcamp has passed away. It&rsquo;s really fun to see the community growing day by day. Next year, I want to join the organization team.</p>

    <id>http://tieubao.github.io/writing/a/training-android-end</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sorry folks for that long time. I’m too busy to release CJayNet v1 and upgrade it to new version v2 so that the daily schedule of Training Android progress cannot be released fully and on time. I will summary it in this blog post.</p>

<p>After someday playing with OOP, I gave Thai a small test that build a mini chess game on console with all current knowledge about OOP. He finished in 2 weeks as expected, simple enough but the code style and architecture was too bad (also as expected).</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2014-12-02-git.png"></p>

<p>To make them can work together later, I introduced to them a concept of version control system, Git (not SVN) and Github with some basic moves that they can understand easily and can apply directly. I found some useful resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">Git &ndash; The simple Guide</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/jbenet/ee6c9ac48068889b0912">a simple git branching model</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/progit/">Gitbook</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Then, we started a android basic training with the material from a <a href="http://duythanhcse.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/bai-t%E1%BA%ADp-1-lam-quen-v%E1%BB%9Bi-moi-tr%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng-phat-tri%E1%BB%83n-di%E1%BB%87n-tho%E1%BA%A1i-di-d%E1%BB%99ng/">blog of mr Duy Thanh</a>.  This guide went through all of basic controls, how to setup environment, what we could do with android, UI design and layout  … You can also find useful resources for android developer in my previous <a href="http://tieubao.me/writing/2013/12/05/resources-every-android-developer-should-know/">blog post</a>. All the exercises source code might be found on their Github. This took them 2 months to complete all the basic lessons.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2014-12-02-trello.png"></p>

<p>June came and I began to give them more advanced lessons likes Android Concurrency, Intent Service, Broadcast Receiver, responsive UI, Database, Notification, EventBus and so on … This took more time when things became complicated. We cost almost 2 months to study all of above topics. The training course finished at the end of August with an simple app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudjay.gossip">Gossip</a>, a clone of Secret.ly.</p>

<p>After all, I realize that, learning speed can be improved a lots if we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Proper syllabus</li>
<li>Useful resources with visual sample</li>
<li>A diligent mentor</li>
<li>and also a working hard with high spirit student</li>
</ul>
