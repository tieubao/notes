<p>Dwarves Foundation is a software development firm that based in South East Asia. Starting in 2014, we use cutting-edge technology to help tech startups, entrepreneurs and makers to deliver world-class software products.</p>

<h1>The Dwarves of the Year</h1>

<p>Many endeavors have significantly been made by our Dwarves to keep our boat moving over the past year. We have seen the sweat they drop. We have seen the effort they give. We have seen the time we spent together and we cannot stop ourselves treasuring those moments. It gratifies the team to eventually hold an award for the Dwarves of the year.</p>

<p>We understand that success does not come by accident. Breakthrough arrives after hours of working and trying. It pushes us through many considerations to finally reach to these three top-notch nominees among those remarkable hard works:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2019-01-26-hall-of-fame.png"></p>

<h3>Huy Nguyen — Outstanding</h3>

<p>Considered for his dynamic contribution, Huy distinguishes himself for being enthusiasm towards the work. His striking performance was shown throughout multiple products. Appears to be the frequent workaholic who dedicates his time more than others, Huy did achieve a remarkable growth.
Beside successfully improving the internal competency, Huy is highly recognized for being a dedicated trainer for interns and co-workers.</p>

<h3>Thanh Pham — Honorable Mention</h3>

<p>Thanh differentiates his work performance during the process of development which assigned him the superior skills on visual and animation. Apart from being a devoted employee, he also plays an integral part of backing up the team and training front-end juniors.
Nevertheless, Thanh finds himself hard to fit in with other Dwarves, which explains the reason his ability in leadership is still in need of improvement.</p>

<h3>Hieu Nguyen — Honorable Mention</h3>

<p>Along with achieving breakthrough change on technical skills and meeting deadline on time with high standard workability, Hieu is well known for being proactive and eager to learn new things. Hieu also proves himself as an adept for new Dwarves to look up and get feedback from.
Though he truly give his best for the work, Hieu’s limited ability of teamwork and leadership still prevents him from being more outstanding.</p>

<p>As there is nothing that can help us measure the contribution you have put, we decided to conduct the award by different means. They are expected to claim the prize based on their titles both in cash and in kind, along with a certificate of recognition as a proof of accomplishment, as well as being honored on our Hall of Fame. Every single piece of trying helps us gradually expand the picture. Live long and prosper has been chosen as one of the mindsets to constitute our woodland from the very first day.</p>

<p>For the sake of that to happen, we understand that their benefit comes parallel to the team. So it will be dead wrong if you think there is a benchmark for the means of award. At Dwarves Foundation, recognition does not work that way. The more they contribute, the more guerdon they receive.</p>

<h1>2018</h1>

<p>2018 has been a fulfilling year for us with many achievements.</p>

<p>We adapted the new team structure; we redefined things we value.</p>

<p>We doubled the office space. We welcomed new dwarves to join us.</p>

<p>We scaled up from 15 to 40ish with all the smart people gathering around and commit to the dream of building our first global software firm.</p>

<p>We learn new ways to get things done; we live by that for a cutting edge product quality. And we wrap it up with the tedious belief of a better triumph.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2019-01-26-year-end-party.jpeg"></p>

<p>Everything is just the beginning of our first chapters and it couldn’t be that great without you. I’m very thankful for all the contributions that you have made and looking forward to 2019 with all of you.</p>

    <id>http://tieubao.github.io/writing/a/what-dwarves-foundation-stand-for</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Innovation happens. There are many startups found and raise fund every day. They focus on making significant positive changes, impact millions of people, lead to breakthroughs and support the foundation of economic growth.</p>

<p>Building an innovation startup requires lots of different things, and it is tough. Most of them have to deal with business development, legal, fundraising, team recruitment, and product development at the same time. Tech startups need to move fast and break things.</p>

<p>At some points, growing a startup needs a strong and experienced team behind. The software team that can help to design the system, design the database, produce the well-crafted software, keep the system stable, avoid the technical debt and deliver values is one of the critical pieces to solve the puzzle.</p>

<p>Another motivations for Dwarves Foundation was the lack of respect that service firms receive. Most software companies out there focus on digital transformation and consultancy. They do tricks. They hit and run. The codebase they produced is full of crap and it damages our pride.</p>

<p>This is where Dwarves Foundation comes in.
Despite the fact that service firms scale linearly, their ultimate size is capped and small, they don’t have life-changing exits for their founders, we start Dwarves Foundation as we want to build things right. I’ve always felt that companies like Dwarves Foundation are more important to the economy than the mildly pejorative phrase used to describe them.</p>

<p>Dwarves Foundation is an innovation service firm. We have been building an organization with high standard software practices and business growth capabilities, helping tech startups, entrepreneurs and makers deliver their innovative software product since 2013.</p>

<p><strong>We stand for the craftsmanship in software development</strong>. More than telling people how to do things, as a firm, we take responsibility for collaboratively creating the product of innovation with the client. We value the long-term partnership, and we brought the economic impact through massive product distribution and brought to the market by the clients.</p>

<p>We empower innovation with software craftsmanship. This is what we do here. It takes many forms, and we’re always working towards it.</p>

<h3>The Dwarves</h3>

<p>The story begins in Norse Mythology. After the executed of Ymir, the very first giant of the universe, by Odin has conceived a whole new universe. In the new world, Yggdrasill is a giant ash tree located at the center cradles the nine realms of the cosmos.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2018-03-19-yggdrasill.png"></p>

<p>Dwarf is the small and misshapen creatures that originated as maggots from Ymir’s corpse. They dwell in the mountains deep down in the dark underground of <strong>Svartalfheim</strong>. Dwarves are wisdom, natural good at smithing, mining, and crafting. They are well known for being the best blacksmiths throughout the nine worlds, not only do they have natural abilities to craft weapons and jewelry. They are also excellent engineers and architects.</p>

<p>Dwarvish magic was fundamentally technological know how. They had an unusually high level of skill. There was no shimmering light around the Dwarves, just first rate workmanship. Dwarves greatly pride themselves in their craftsmanship, be it smithing or anything else.</p>

<p>The dwarf is an example of a creature who has the ability that surpasses the known world, presaging the rise of a universe beyond this physical realm. Whatever their origin, the dwarf’s existence plays a role in expanding the imagination.</p>

<p>Aspiring to create a positive breakthrough that can be able to rewrite the new world, we chose the name Dwarves Foundation as the commitment to the vision that we follow.</p>

<p>At our woodland, the Dwarves are encouraged to thoroughly assess and evaluate the product quality before handing it to the customers. By participate in every detail of the work, we take craftsmanship as one of the most fundamental factors of the career transformation for engineers. World-class products require world-class engineers and craftsmanship is what makes it done. Craftsmanship is what flows among the team spirit, or does not exist at all.</p>

<p>We choose innovation to be one of our core values that form ideas to affect the general society undoubtedly. Innovation is not for geniuses working alone, it is an activity that requires the team effort. Being innovative is a part to approach the new era. What that rewards, what can I say, can genuinely lead to significantly remodel the cosmo.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2018-03-19-dwarves.jpg"></p>

<p>Empower innovation is the lifestyle we choose and we are always welcome the like minded people to join us on this journey.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After an interesting journey at <a href="/a/cau-chuyen-khoi-nghiep-tu-lifebox-den-cloudjay-p1/">CloudJay</a>, I took a short break for a month and feel that startup life is too hard for young people but it&rsquo;s really worth to be a part startup scene. Someone said, one year to live in a startup is better than five years working in the enterprise. And I think this is correct. I need to face more problems and be able to solve them myself to be more mature.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2015-06-17-entrepreneur.jpg"></p>

<p>I also find that Google Golang is interesting and it might be useful for us later. I bet my investment on it and found <a href="https://golang.org.vn">Golang Vietnam</a>, a network of Golang Developers in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Based on some connections with friends in Singapore, I start asking people about other software businesses. And begin to find my first early member. I named a team <a href="https://dwarves.foundation">Dwarves Foundation</a>. Dwarf is the small and misshapen creatures in Norse Mythology that are wisdom, natural good at smithing, mining, and crafting.

<h2>Workflow at Dwarves Foundation</h2>

<h3>For project management</h3>

<p>We use Trello with Kanban theory to organize tasks. Tasks will be flew from left list to right list. We also organize lists into Scrum steps. So this will be liked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sprint Planning</li>
<li>Current Sprint</li>
<li>In Progress</li>
<li>Blocked</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Bugs Report</li>
<li>Approved</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/blog/2015-06-17-trello.png"></p>

<p>For each project, we will have <em>Sprint planning meeting</em> for Project Manager to explain project details to project members. User stories will be converted into cards or tickets and added to Trello list > <strong>Sprint Planning</strong>.</p>

<p>Usually, one sprint is about 1 or 2 weeks, we have weekly meeting to break user stories into tasks and add them to list Current Sprint. It&rsquo;s also our target for this week, we have to get in done. This time, cards need to have requirement and non requirement specification. And sometimes, if this task has some special requirement that developers need to care about, the Project Manager need to add <strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2015-06-17-criteria.png"></p>

<p>As a customer, you are granted permission to access Trello Board to give feedback or be a tester. And most of my customers are happy with it.</p>

<p>The template for this workflow can be found at <a href="https://trello.com/b/WYgcFBgl/sprint-template">https://trello.com/b/WYgcFBgl/sprint-template</a></p>

<h3>For source code management</h3>

<p>We use <code>git</code> and GitLab. It&rsquo;s more like GitHub but for enterprise. You can have one by downloading and deploying it yourself.</p>

<p>We apply <a href="http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/">Gitflow</a> and <code>Merge Request</code> (some people may call it Pull Request) between developers to gain some benefits from it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can deliver anytime because branch <code>master</code> is always stable.</li>
<li>Quality source code: always review it after it&rsquo;s merged into branch <code>develep</code></li>
<li>High efficiency collaboration between team members.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/blog/2015-06-17-gitflow.png"></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another article about it on Atlassian site: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow</a></p>

<p>Project Manager will be the one that init the repository on Git with some imporatant informations. For every ticket on Trello, developers need to create one issue in GitLab, create new feature branch and start the implementation on it. The <code>git commit</code> command must attach with one or more than one issue.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2015-06-17-commit.png"></p>

<p>After that, one merge request will be created and the person who has responsibility to review this request need to check over the source code then <code>Accept</code> or <code>Reject</code> the <code>Merge Request</code>.</p>

<p>This card will be moved to list <code>Testing</code>, QC will be assigned to test this feature and so on.</p>

<h3>For Communication</h3>

<p>We use <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> as the main hub for all informations, from team meeting, hangout, manage tasks and source code &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2015-06-17-slack.png"></p>

<p>Slack support lots of methods to add integration. So the powerful it can be depends on what you integrate into it.</p>

<p>Finally, at the end of the day, we do daily meeting via hangout or face to face at the office to summary what we have done today and what we plan to do tomorrow. The project manager will be the one to write it down and make weekly report to customer.</p>

<p>All the processes out there are just to make the team stick together and development plan works. All team members need to understand their roles, team vision and know how to make things go on the right tracks.</p>
