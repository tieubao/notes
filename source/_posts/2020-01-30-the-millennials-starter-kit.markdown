The below knowledge & wisdom are what I have been collected and accumulated over the years. They are my building blocks, the crucial bits that help shape up my mental model, perspective, and principles in life. Get to know them can help you save up a few years digging around if you find it the same way. I don't try to convince any of you, and I will try to keep them short and concise.

A bit about myself for your reference.

- I'm an Asian (Saigon), male, 30 years old. 
- I'm a software engineer, a nerd, an atheist, and a science advocate. Religions to me is another perspective to life, and I don't resist it.
- I'm also a self-taught CEO, a team lead. I have been running a small software firm called Dwarves Foundation for five years. I make enough for living, and my net worth is reaching 1M this year.

They are the ground that I'm on before going further.
