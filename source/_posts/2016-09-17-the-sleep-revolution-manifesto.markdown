description: In your life, you spend 1/3 your life to sleep. It's not how much you sleep, it's how you sleep.

The below manifesto is excerp from the book [^1]. Reading them carefully help me a lot. Work & Life balance is always a nice & endless topic.

1. Sleep is a fundamental and non-negotiable human need.
2. Sleep allows us to see the world with fresh eyes and a reinvigorated spirit.
3. We may be what we eat, but also, to be sure, we are how we sleep.
4. Exhaustion is a sign of chaos, not a badge of honor.
5. A good day starts the night before.
6. We will treat ourselves as well as we treat our smartphones, making sure we sleep until fully recharged.
7. A bedroom should be an oasis: a beautiful, relaxing escape from the demands of the day.
8. We will usher our smartphones out of the bedroom when we go to bed.
9. We will not drive if we are drowsy!
10. We will choose Ògoing-to-bed clothes," not to be confused with Ògoing-to-the-gym clothes." Pajamas, nightdresses, and even special T-shirts send a sleep-friendly signal to our bodies: time to shut down!
11. We will choose sleep over busywork.
12. When we walk through the door of our bedroom, we will leave the day–with all of its problems and unfinished business–behind.
