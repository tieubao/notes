We love to work at night, not daytime. We have coffee and tea, people to talk with, place to work and corner to take a nap. We love to discuss about engineering, technology and life hacking stuffs. We are outliers, we are special and we know it. We want to make friend with people that like us.

### 9owl - Working space that only available at night

Me, have an idea that can cool people should know each other, have a place to come and work at night, to be friends or not. But I believe that people that live the same lifestyle, have same mindset should be easy to make friend and more. So I start 9owl and give the office for free.

[**9owl**](http://dwarvesf.com/9owl/) is **invite only** group and it costs you nothing. Join us for the midnight coffee, good talks, warm bed and cool work place.

Here are our current members:
