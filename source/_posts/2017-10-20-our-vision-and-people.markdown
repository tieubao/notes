Just a few quick notes over the meeting today with 2 new friends. A couple of an US and Vietnamese which has engineering background, started the software company in Vietnam. Some issues within the team and late delivery cause them headaches and stresses.

During the meeting, we was having the good talk and sharing on how to setup, manage and work with the team. Thru the conversation, I'm happy to realize how lucky I am.

If you remembered, the journey of Dwarves Foundation started 3 years ago when the CloudJay team decided to disband. At the time being, as a solo founder and 2 early members

The culture is something hard to tell if you do it right or wrong. Teamwork is also the things to discuss. 

What we enable at Dwarves Foundation

Transparency

It's obvious for you to know others monthly paycheck. You have the right for it.
