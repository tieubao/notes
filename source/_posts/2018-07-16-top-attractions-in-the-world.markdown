# The list

Being an advocate traveler, I spent quite a lot time planning for the next trip. Last year, I took a trip around Vietnam, from Saigon to Hanoi and all the nearby areas, including Dien Bien, Ha Giang and Ha Long city. That was really fun and I am proud of doing it.

Recently I have found a short list of [250 world destinations and attractions](https://www.listchallenges.com/top-250-world-destinations-and-attractions). Most of the places are great, though it is a bit biased toward Europe and Americas.

Below are a few places I'm planning to visit this 2018. I will visit Japan in Sept and Taiwan in Nov.

#### Japan

1. Tokyo Tower
2. Osaka Castle
3. Sensoji Temple
4. Mount Fuji
5. Kiyomizu Temple
6. Tokyo Imperial Palace

#### Taiwan

1. Jiufen
2. ?

Not so much attractions could be found in Taiwan maybe they are not at the same level with the others. 

### Updated

I have visited Japan and it was [awesome]()
