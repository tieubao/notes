- Decision makers

# Initial Growth

# Rapid Growth

CEOs need to:

- Hire people with more knowledge than themselves in the key business functions
- Get the team to function as a 'team', to plan and communicate

# Continuous Growth

CEOs need to:

- Become strategic innovators & change catalysts
- Lead the company culture
