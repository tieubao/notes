description: CloudJay Android Training Course at 3rd and 4th day

---

Thai studied faster than my expectation. At 3rd and 4th day, I give him some oop presentations from `mr. nmhuy` about `polymorphism` and `inheritance`.

Every time he got problem or something went wrong, we work remotely through TeamViewer and Skype. Exercises was assigned through Trello cards. 

#####Agenda

- polymorphism in oop
- inheritance in oop
- exercises about them
