The happy startup:

* Define your startup DNA
* Keep the main thing, the main thing
* Bring design on board from day one
* Validate ideas early and test assumptions
* Build a business, not a pitch
* Stop selling and start listening
* Get the balance right between MVP and perfection
* Get a mentor and build your support network
* 90% of entrepreneurship is sales. It’s time to start hustling.
* It’s all about people. Hire the best you can
