	<div class="entry-content"><p>After an interesting journey at <a href="/notes/a/cau-chuyen-khoi-nghiep-tu-lifebox-den-cloudjay-p1/">CloudJay</a>, I took a short break for a month and feel that startup life is too hard for young people but it&rsquo;s really worth to be a part startup scene. Someone said, one year to live in a startup is better than five years working in the enterprise. And I think this is correct. I need to face more problems and be able to solve them myself to be more mature.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-entrepreneur.jpg"></p>

<p>I also find that Google Golang is interesting and it might be useful for us later. I bet my investment on it and found <a href="https://golang.org.vn">Golang Vietnam</a>, a network of Golang Developers in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Based on some connections with friends in Singapore, I start asking people about other software businesses. And begin to find my first early member. I named a team <a href="https://dwarves.foundation">Dwarves Foundation</a>. Dwarf is the small and misshapen creatures in Norse Mythology that are wisdom, natural good at smithing, mining, and crafting. My plan is to provide Tech Partner service to ventures and startups.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-dwarves.jpg"></p>

<h2>Workflow at Dwarves Foundation</h2>

<h3>For project management</h3>

<p>We use Trello with Kanban theory to organize tasks. Tasks will be flew from left list to right list. We also organize lists into Scrum steps. So this will be liked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sprint Planning</li>
<li>Current Sprint</li>
<li>In Progress</li>
<li>Blocked</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Bugs Report</li>
<li>Approved</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-trello.png"></p>

<p>For each project, we will have <em>Sprint planning meeting</em> for Project Manager to explain project details to project members. User stories will be converted into cards or tickets and added to Trello list > <strong>Sprint Planning</strong>.</p>

<p>Usually, one sprint is about 1 or 2 weeks, we have weekly meeting to break user stories into tasks and add them to list Current Sprint. It&rsquo;s also our target for this week, we have to get in done. This time, cards need to have requirement and non requirement specification. And sometimes, if this task has some special requirement that developers need to care about, the Project Manager need to add <strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-criteria.png"></p>

<p>As a customer, you are granted permission to access Trello Board to give feedback or be a tester. And most of my customers are happy with it.</p>

<p>The template for this workflow can be found at <a href="https://trello.com/b/WYgcFBgl/sprint-template">https://trello.com/b/WYgcFBgl/sprint-template</a></p>

<h3>For source code management</h3>

<p>We use <code>git</code> and GitLab. It&rsquo;s more like GitHub but for enterprise. You can have one by downloading and deploying it yourself.</p>

<p>We apply <a href="http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/">Gitflow</a> and <code>Merge Request</code> (some people may call it Pull Request) between developers to gain some benefits from it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can deliver anytime because branch <code>master</code> is always stable.</li>
<li>Quality source code: always review it after it&rsquo;s merged into branch <code>develep</code></li>
<li>High efficiency collaboration between team members.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-gitflow.png"></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another article about it on Atlassian site: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow</a></p>

<p>Project Manager will be the one that init the repository on Git with some imporatant informations. For every ticket on Trello, developers need to create one issue in GitLab, create new feature branch and start the implementation on it. The <code>git commit</code> command must attach with one or more than one issue.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-commit.png"></p>

<p>After that, one merge request will be created and the person who has responsibility to review this request need to check over the source code then <code>Accept</code> or <code>Reject</code> the <code>Merge Request</code>.</p>

<p>This card will be moved to list <code>Testing</code>, QC will be assigned to test this feature and so on.</p>

<h3>For Communication</h3>

<p>We use <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> as the main hub for all informations, from team meeting, hangout, manage tasks and source code &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2015-06-17-slack.png"></p>

<p>Slack support lots of methods to add integration. So the powerful it can be depends on what you integrate into it.</p>

<p>Finally, at the end of the day, we do daily meeting via hangout or face to face at the office to summary what we have done today and what we plan to do tomorrow. The project manager will be the one to write it down and make weekly report to customer.</p>

<p>All the processes out there are just to make the team stick together and development plan works. All team members need to understand their roles, team vision and know how to make things go on the right tracks.</p>
