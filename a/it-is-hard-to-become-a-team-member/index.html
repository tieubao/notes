	<div class="entry-content"><p>I was working at a tech startup called CloudJay (former Lifebox JSC). Our team has nine including engineers and business development. As we&rsquo;ve known, there are many factors to make a successful business and teamwork is one of them. In my opinion, this is the most important.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2014-02-05-teamwork-01.jpg"></p>

<p>The startup, in common sense, is founded to solve people problems, real problems; to provide works for society, also to bring values and make money. That is a thing that people called the vision, team vision, company vision. As the team member, you should understand it clearly, love it or hate it and follow it, make it your life, your working purpose. A team does not need employees but contributors.</p>

<p>The team still need heroes, and there should be an &lsquo;I&rsquo; in the team but <strong>the only way to make the boat go fast is perfect coordination</strong>, it also means perfect teamwork and synchronization. The skill set is essential, but it isn&rsquo;t important as vision and coordination. The &lsquo;I&rsquo; must be unselfish and think about the team first. As a team member, it’s important to remember that no one is perfect; everyone has something that they could improve upon, including yourself. So, be supportive. Offer constructive criticism. Listen, listen, listen. People who always talk, but never listen will be stunted in growth. Remember that everyone knows something you don’t know.</p>

<p><img src="/notes/images/blog/2014-02-05-teamwork-02.jpg"></p>

<p>We effectively have an environment in which competition and collaboration co-exist and feed off each other. Competition, synchronization or collaborating perfectly; make the boat go fast is always the main point. Remember, even if you work harder than anyone else, <strong>if you lose synchronization, you slow the boat down.</strong></p>
